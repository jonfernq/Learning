## Small Projects 

> If one has a small portfolio project which one wishes to deploy asDocker containers and test on GCP, is there a free tier? Can precautions be taken to control expenditures and protect others from accessing system?
 
Yes, Google Cloud offers a free tier which allows you to use certain services and features for free up to a certain limit. This can be a great option for hobby projects and small deployments. Here are some details about the Google Cloud free tier: 
- Free Trial: Google Cloud offers a 12-month free trial with a credit of $300 which can be used towards any Google Cloud services. 
- Always Free: Google Cloud also offers an "Always Free" tier which provides limited usage of certain services, such as Compute Engine, App Engine, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Storage. These services have usage limits and may have some restrictions, but they can be used for free indefinitely.

To control expenditures and protect your system, here are some precautions you can take: 
- Set up billing alerts: Google Cloud allows you to set up billing alerts to receive notifications when your usage reaches a certain limit. This can help you avoid unexpected charges. 
- Use resource quotas: You can set resource quotas for your projects to limit the amount of resources that can be used by your deployments. This can help you control costs and prevent excessive resource usage. 
- Use IAM roles: Google Cloud offers Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles which allow you to control who has access to your resources and what they can do with them. You can create custom IAM roles with specific permissions to ensure that only authorized users have access to your system. 
- Use firewalls and security rules: Google Cloud offers firewalls and security rules which allow you to control network access to your resources. You can create rules to allow only specific IP addresses or networks to access your system, and you can also configure SSL certificates and other security measures to protect your deployments.

By taking these precautions, you can help control costs and protect your system on Google Cloud while still being able to deploy and test your Docker containers.
