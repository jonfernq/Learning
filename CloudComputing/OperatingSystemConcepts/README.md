## Cloud Computing & Operating System Concepts 

> How does the concept of process relate to Docker containers running on a Linux system? 

In Docker, a container is essentially an instance of a running image. An image is a read-only template that contains a set of instructions for creating a container. When a container is created from an image, it is launched as a process that is isolated from the host system and other containers running on the same host.

In Linux, a process is a running instance of a program. It has its own memory space, system resources, and state. Similarly, a Docker container is a lightweight process that runs in its own namespace, which isolates it from other processes on the system. This allows containers to run independently, with their own resources and state, even if they are running on the same host.

The process concept is fundamental to Docker containers, as each container is essentially a running process that can be started, stopped, or managed independently from other containers running on the same host. This provides a high level of flexibility and portability, as containers can be easily moved between hosts and managed using standard process management tools.

> A cloud computing 'virtual machine'  running under AWS or GPC seems different from the Java virtual machine?  Please compare and contrast. 

A cloud computing virtual machine (VM) and the Java virtual machine (JVM) are two different concepts and serve different purposes.

A cloud computing virtual machine is a virtual representation of a physical machine with its own operating system, hardware, and software configurations. It can be rented or purchased from cloud service providers like AWS or GCP, and is used to host applications, store data, or run specific software. Users have full access to the virtual machine and can manage it like a physical machine, including installing and configuring the operating system and applications.

On the other hand, the Java virtual machine is an abstract computing machine that provides a runtime environment for Java programs. It is a software implementation of a computer that executes Java bytecode and provides a platform-independent environment for running Java applications. The JVM abstracts away hardware and operating system-specific details and provides a consistent environment for running Java applications.

The main difference between the two is that a cloud computing virtual machine is a complete operating system with all the necessary software, while the JVM is a runtime environment that runs on top of an operating system. A cloud computing virtual machine is used to host a variety of applications and services, while the JVM is specifically designed to run Java applications.

In summary, a cloud computing virtual machine is a virtualized representation of a physical machine, while the Java virtual machine is a software implementation of a computer that provides a runtime environment for Java applications.
