## AWS Architecture: Integration of Three Tier Web and Analytics

**PROBLEM:**

You are working for a customer that runs their workloads on premises. Your customer has two workloads:

1. A three-tier architecture composed of a frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), backend (Apache Web Server and a Java application), and database (MySQL). The three-tier application hosts a dynamic website that accepts user traffic from the internet.

2. A data analytics workload that runs Apache Hadoop. The analytics workload analyzes a massive amount of data that stored on premises and it also uses visualization tools to derive insights.

These components are currently running in the data center on physical servers. Currently, if a power outage occurred in the data center, all systems would be brought offline. Because of this issue (in addition to other benefits of the cloud), your customer wants to migrate all components to the cloud and, when possible, use AWS services to replace on-premises components.

You have been tasked with designing a solution that uses AWS services to decouple the application layers (frontend, backend, and database), and that hosts both the application and the data analytics workload in the cloud. 

Also, the data analytics solution currently runs on Hadoop and you have a requirement to spin up an Amazon EMR cluster for it. However, itâ€™s up to you to choose which AWS services you want to use for the ingestion, storage, and visualization of data.

Use AWS managed services and advocate for refactoring the code to take advantage of cloud-native technologies. 

Write an explanation that details how the solution works and why you chose to use the services that you selected. Also, create an architecture diagram that depicts how both solutions will be hosted on AWS.

**SOLUTION:** 

Overall, the solution architecture follows a typical three-tier architecture pattern, where the web tier handles incoming requests and forwards them to the application tier, which further interacts with the database tier for data storage and retrieval. The use of load balancers, auto-scaling groups, and managed services like RDS, S3, EMR, and QuickSight helps ensure scalability, availability, and ease of management for the application.

![aws_diagram](https://github.com/jonfernq/Learning/assets/68504324/0b1fc807-a8a8-4370-a773-dcd5e98b44fa)

Explanation of architectural elements: 

1. Internet: This represents the external network or the internet from which requests originate.
    
2. Amazon Route 53: Route 53 is a scalable domain name system (DNS) web service provided by AWS. It routes the incoming requests from the internet to the appropriate services within the architecture based on the defined DNS configurations.
    
3. Application Load Balancer (ALB): The ALB is responsible for distributing incoming application traffic across multiple instances of the web tier. It performs advanced request routing and can handle HTTP and HTTPS traffic. It helps improve availability and scalability by distributing traffic evenly across healthy instances.
    
4. EC2 Auto Scaling Group (Frontend Instances): This group consists of multiple EC2 instances that host the frontend of the application. EC2 Auto Scaling helps automatically adjust the number of instances based on demand, ensuring high availability and scalability.
    
5. Elastic Beanstalk (Backend): Elastic Beanstalk is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering by AWS. It provides an environment to deploy, manage, and scale applications. In this architecture, it hosts the backend instances, which handle the application logic and data processing.
    
6. Amazon RDS (MySQL): Amazon RDS is a managed relational database service by AWS. In this architecture, it hosts the MySQL database, providing a reliable and scalable storage solution for the application. The backend instances interact with the RDS instance to store and retrieve data.
    
7. Amazon S3 (Storage): Amazon S3 is an object storage service that provides scalable and durable storage for various types of data. It is often used for storing and retrieving large amounts of unstructured data, such as images, videos, and backups. In this architecture, Amazon S3 after the RDS instance is used for storing files alongside the database.
    
8. Amazon EMR (Hadoop): Amazon EMR is a managed big data platform that utilizes Apache Hadoop. It enables processing and analysis of large datasets using distributed computing.
    
9. Amazon QuickSight (Data Visualization): Amazon QuickSight is a business intelligence (BI) service enabling organizations to create interactive dashboards and visualizations to analyze data, generating insights and reports based on the data stored in RDS or EMR.
    
Two additional elements, an elastic cache tier before the RDS instance and an additional 'standby' instance after the RDS instance, are added to supplement the RDS instance in the database tier of the architecture that provide performance benefits:

1. **ElastiCache Tier**: Elasticache is an AWS managed service that provides an in-memory data store to improve the performance and scalability of applications. In this case, adding an ElastiCache tier before the RDS instance would involve using Amazon ElastiCache for caching frequently accessed data from the database.

Benefits:

* Improved Performance: ElastiCache reduces the latency and improves the response time of database queries by caching frequently accessed data in-memory. This reduces the load on the RDS instance, resulting in faster data retrieval.
* Scalability: ElastiCache is horizontally scalable, allowing you to add or remove cache nodes as needed to handle varying workloads. This helps to handle increased traffic without impacting the RDS instance's performance.
* Cost Optimization: By offloading read-intensive operations to ElastiCache, you can reduce the load on the RDS instance, potentially allowing you to use a smaller and more cost-effective RDS instance.

2. **Standby Instance**: Adding a standby instance after the RDS instance involves setting up a read replica or a Multi-AZ deployment for high availability and fault tolerance.

Benefits:

* High Availability: By setting up a standby instance using Multi-AZ or read replica, you ensure that there is a replica of the RDS instance that can take over automatically in case of a failure. This minimizes downtime and ensures continuity of operations.
* Fault Tolerance: With a standby instance, you have a redundant copy of your database that can handle failover seamlessly. This provides protection against infrastructure failures, ensuring your application remains accessible and operational.
* Load Distribution: If you configure your application to distribute read traffic across both the primary RDS instance and the standby instance, you can offload read operations from the primary instance, reducing the load and improving overall performance.

By adding an ElastiCache tier and a standby instance, you enhance the performance, scalability, and availability of your architecture. These additions help optimize the system's response time, handle increased traffic, and protect against failures, resulting in an improved user experience and system reliability.

## Analytics Workflow: Detailed Description

The analytics workflow works briefly as follows. First, transfer data to Amazon S3 for storage, process data using Amazon EMR, and finally visualize the results using Amazon QuickSight. This enables one to leverage the power of big data analytics for deriving insights and making data-driven decisions. Here's a step-by-step more detailed explanation:

1. Data Extraction: SQL queries are used to extract data from the RDS database. These extracts are placed in S3 storage.  

2. Exporting to Amazon S3: Once SQL queries have extracted data from the RDS database, it is exported to Amazon S3 storage. Amazon S3 provides a reliable and scalable storage solution for large amounts of data. The AWS command-line interface (CLI) or SDKs can be used to transfer the data from your RDS instance to an S3 bucket. This can be done in various formats like CSV or JSON 
    
3. Data Processing with Amazon EMR: After the data is stored in Amazon S3, an Amazon EMR cluster is set up to process the data using distributed computing frameworks such as Apache Hadoop, Spark, or Presto. EMR simplifies the setup and management of big data infrastructure. You can define the processing steps and transformations you want to apply to the data using Hadoop-based tools like MapReduce or higher-level frameworks like Apache Spark. EMR reads the data from S3, performs the specified computations, and generates the desired results or derived datasets.
    
4. Storing Analyzed Data: Once the data processing is complete, the analyzed or transformed data can be stored back in Amazon S3 in a structured format providing easy access for further analysis or visualization.

5. Visualization with Amazon QuickSight: With the processed data available in Amazon S3, you can connect Amazon QuickSight to the S3 bucket and create interactive visualizations, dashboards, and reports. QuickSight provides a user-friendly interface for creating visualizations and exploring data. You can configure the data source in QuickSight to access the processed data stored in S3 and create visual representations of the insights derived from the data.

### Breakdown into Component Parts

#### First Part: Three Tier Architecture

For the first part, we create a 3-tier architecture on AWS using the command line interface (CLI). This architecture consists of the web tier, application tier, and database tier.

In the web tier, we have two web instances that will handle the presentation of our web application. These instances will be launched in public subnets and will be load balanced using an Application Load Balancer. The load balancer will distribute incoming traffic evenly between the web instances, ensuring high availability and scalability.

Moving on to the application tier, we have two application instances that will handle the logic and processing of data received from the web tier. These instances will be launched in private subnets, which provide an additional layer of security by restricting direct access from the internet. The application instances will communicate with the web tier through the load balancer.

Finally, in the database tier, we have an RDS (Relational Database Service) instance that will store and manage our data. The RDS instance will also be launched in a private subnet to ensure secure access. The application instances from the application tier will interact with the database tier to retrieve and store data.

In this diagram, the web tier consists of two instances (Web Instance 1 and Web Instance 2) running in public subnets. These instances are behind an Application Load Balancer, which distributes traffic to the instances.

The application tier consists of two instances (App Instance 1 and App Instance 2) running in private subnets. These instances process the data received from the web tier.

The database tier includes an RDS instance running in a private subnet. This is where the application tier interacts with the database.

Additional component details remain to be added such as security groups, routing tables, and NAT gateways, required to ensure proper network connectivity and security.

#### AWS CLI Commands

For the first part, AWS CLI commands are used to set up this architecture via the AWS command line interface. These commands create virtual private cloud (VPC) resources, such as subnets and security groups, launch instances with a given configuration, and configure a load balancer and database instance.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the AWS CLI commands:

**WEB TIER:**

Step 1: Creating the VPC and subnets:

```shell
# Create VPC
aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block <vpc-cidr-block> --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=vpc,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=<vpc-name>}]'

# Create public subnets
aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id <vpc-id> --cidr-block <public-subnet-cidr-block> --availability-zone <availability-zone> --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=subnet,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=<public-subnet-name>}]'
aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id <vpc-id> --cidr-block <public-subnet-cidr-block> --availability-zone <availability-zone> --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=subnet,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=<public-subnet-name>}]'

# Create private subnets
aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id <vpc-id> --cidr-block <private-subnet-cidr-block> --availability-zone <availability-zone> --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=subnet,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=<private-subnet-name>}]'
aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id <vpc-id> --cidr-block <private-subnet-cidr-block> --availability-zone <availability-zone> --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=subnet,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=<private-subnet-name>}]'
aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id <vpc-id> --cidr-block <private-subnet-cidr-block> --availability-zone <availability-zone> --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=subnet,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=<private-subnet-name>}]'
aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id <vpc-id> --cidr-block <private-subnet-cidr-block> --availability-zone <availability-zone> --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=subnet,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=<private-subnet-name>}]'

# Create NAT gateway
aws ec2 create-nat-gateway --subnet-id <public-subnet-id> --allocation-id <eip-allocation-id> --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=natgateway,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=<nat-gateway-name>}]'
```

Step 2: Creating launch template:

```shell
# Create launch template
aws ec2 create-launch-template --launch-template-name <web-tier-launch-template-name> --launch-template-data file://web-tier-launch-template.json
```

Note: A JSON file named "web-tier-launch-template.json" is needed with the required launch template configuration.

Step 3: Create Auto Scaling Group

```shell
# Create auto scaling group
aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name <web-tier-auto-scaling-group-name> --launch-template "LaunchTemplateName=<web-tier-launch-template-name>,Version=<version>" --min-size 2 --max-size 5 --target-group-arns <target-group-arn> --vpc-zone-identifier "<private-subnet-1>,<private-subnet-2>"
```

### **APPLICATION TIER:**

Step 1: Create Application Launch Template

```shell
# Create launch template
aws ec2 create-launch-template --launch-template-name <application-tier-launch-template-name> --launch-template-data file://application-tier-launch-template.json
```

Note: A JSON file named "application-tier-launch-template.json" is needed with the required launch template configuration.

Step 2: Create Auto Scaling Group

```shell
# Create auto scaling group
aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name <application-tier-auto-scaling-group-name> --launch-template "LaunchTemplateName=<application-tier-launch-template-name>,Version=<version>" --min-size 2 --max-size 5 --vpc-zone-identifier "<private-subnet-1>,<private-subnet-2>"
```

Note: Replace `<application-tier-auto-scaling-group-name>` with a desired name for the auto scaling group, `<application-tier-launch-template-name>` with the name of the application tier launch template created in the previous step, `<version>` with the version number of the launch template, and `<private-subnet-1>` and `<private-subnet-2>` with the IDs of the private subnets where you want to launch the application instances.

With these commands, a launch template for the application tier and an auto scaling group is created that will ensure the chosen application instances are running and properly scaled based on the specified minimum and maximum sizes.

Configure the launch template JSON file (`application-tier-launch-template.json`) with the necessary instance configurations, security groups, and other settings as per your requirements.

**DATABASE TIER:**

Here are the AWS CLI commands to complete the setup for the database tier:

Step 1: Creating a Database Instance

To create a database instance:

```shell
# Create database instance
aws rds create-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <db-instance-identifier> --db-instance-class <db-instance-class> --engine <engine> --allocated-storage <allocated-storage> --master-username <master-username> --master-user-password <master-user-password> --vpc-security-group-ids <vpc-security-group-ids> --availability-zone <availability-zone>
```

Note: Replace `<db-instance-identifier>` with a unique identifier for your database instance, `<db-instance-class>` with the desired instance class, `<engine>` with the database engine (e.g., "mysql" or "postgres"), `<allocated-storage>` with the amount of storage to allocate in GB, `<master-username>` and `<master-user-password>` with the credentials for the master user, `<vpc-security-group-ids>` with the ID of the security group associated with the database instance, and `<availability-zone>` with the desired availability zone.

Step 2: Create Read Replicas (optional)

To create read replicas for your database:

```shell
# Create read replica
aws rds create-db-instance-read-replica --db-instance-identifier <db-instance-identifier> --source-db-instance-identifier <source-db-instance-identifier> --availability-zone <availability-zone>
```

Note: Replace `<db-instance-identifier>` with a unique identifier for the read replica, `<source-db-instance-identifier>` with the identifier of the source database instance, and `<availability-zone>` with the desired availability zone.

Step 3: Configure Database Security Group

```shell
# Authorize inbound access to the database
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <database-security-group-id> --protocol tcp --port <port> --source-group <source-security-group>
```

Note: Replace `<database-security-group-id>` with the ID of the security group associated with the database instance, `<port>` with the port number used by your database engine (e.g., 3306 for MySQL), and `<source-security-group>` with the ID of the security group associated with your application instances.

With these commands, you can create the database instance, configure read replicas if necessary, and set up the necessary security group rules to allow inbound access to the database from your application instances.

Explanation of the Solution:

1. **Amazon Route 53**: We use Amazon Route 53 as the DNS service to route incoming traffic from the internet to our application. It provides domain registration and DNS management, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.
    
2. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: The ALB acts as the entry point for the frontend layer of the three-tier architecture. It distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group to ensure scalability and fault tolerance.
    
3. **EC2 Auto Scaling Group**: The Auto Scaling group manages the frontend instances that host the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components of the application. It automatically scales the number of instances based on demand, allowing the application to handle varying levels of user traffic.
    
4. **Elastic Beanstalk**: Elastic Beanstalk is used to deploy and manage the backend layer of the three-tier application. It supports various platforms, including Java, and automatically handles the deployment, capacity provisioning, load balancing, and health monitoring of the backend application.
    
5. **Amazon RDS (MySQL)**: We use Amazon RDS to host the MySQL database, which serves as the backend data store for the application. Amazon RDS provides a managed database service, ensuring high availability, durability, and automated backups.
    
6. **Amazon S3**: Amazon S3 serves as the storage solution for the data analytics workload. It provides highly scalable and durable object storage for the massive amount of data that needs to be ingested and processed by the analytics workload.
    
7. **Amazon EMR**: Amazon EMR is used to run the Apache Hadoop-based data analytics workload. EMR provides a managed cluster platform for big data processing, allowing us to spin up Hadoop clusters on-demand. By leveraging EMR, we can take advantage of its scalability, fault tolerance, and integration with other AWS services.
    
8. **Amazon QuickSight**: QuickSight

aws rds create-db-instance --db-instance-identifier my-db-instance --db-instance-class db.t2.micro --engine MySQL --master-username myuser --master-user-password mypassword --allocated-storage 20 --vpc-security-group-ids sg-12345678 --availability-zone us-west-2a
```

6. Create an Amazon S3 bucket:

```shell
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket my-bucket --region us-west-2
```

7. Create an Amazon EMR cluster:

```shell
aws emr create-cluster --name my-emr-cluster --release-label emr-6.5.0 --applications Name=Hadoop Name=Hive --ec2-attributes KeyName=my-key-pair --instance-type m5.xlarge --instance-count 3 --use-default-roles
```

Once you have executed these commands, you will have the foundational components set up for your system. Remember to replace the placeholder values (e.g., subnet-1a123456, sg-12345678) with the appropriate values for your specific configuration.
