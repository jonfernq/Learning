## AWS System Design

**PROBLEM:**

You are working for a customer that runs their workloads on premises. Your customer has two workloads:

1. A three-tier architecture composed of a frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), backend (Apache Web Server and a Java application), and database (MySQL). The three-tier application hosts a dynamic website that accepts user traffic from the internet.

2. A data analytics workload that runs Apache Hadoop. The analytics workload analyzes a massive amount of data that stored on premises and it also uses visualization tools to derive insights.

These components are currently running in the data center on physical servers. Currently, if a power outage occurred in the data center, all systems would be brought offline. Because of this issue (in addition to other benefits of the cloud), your customer wants to migrate all components to the cloud and, when possible, use AWS services to replace on-premises components.

You have been tasked with designing a solution that uses AWS services to decouple the application layers (frontend, backend, and database), and that hosts both the application and the data analytics workload in the cloud. 

Also, the data analytics solution currently runs on Hadoop and you have a requirement to spin up an Amazon EMR cluster for it. However, itâ€™s up to you to choose which AWS services you want to use for the ingestion, storage, and visualization of data.

Use AWS managed services and advocate for refactoring the code to take advantage of cloud-native technologies. 

Write an explanation that details how the solution works and why you chose to use the services that you selected. Also, create an architecture diagram that depicts how both solutions will be hosted on AWS.

**SOLUTION:** 

We are setting up a 3-tier architecture on AWS using the command line interface (CLI). This architecture consists of the web tier, application tier, and database tier.

In the web tier, we have two web instances that will handle the presentation of our web application. These instances will be launched in public subnets and will be load balanced using an Application Load Balancer. The load balancer will distribute incoming traffic evenly between the web instances, ensuring high availability and scalability.

Moving on to the application tier, we have two application instances that will handle the logic and processing of data received from the web tier. These instances will be launched in private subnets, which provide an additional layer of security by restricting direct access from the internet. The application instances will communicate with the web tier through the load balancer.

Finally, in the database tier, we have an RDS (Relational Database Service) instance that will store and manage our data. The RDS instance will also be launched in a private subnet to ensure secure access. The application instances from the application tier will interact with the database tier to retrieve and store data.

To set up this architecture using the command line interface, we will need to use various AWS CLI commands. These commands will involve creating virtual private cloud (VPC) resources, such as subnets and security groups, launching instances with the desired configurations, and configuring the load balancer and database instance.

By following this command line setup, we can achieve a scalable and highly available 3-tier architecture on AWS, where each tier performs its specific role in the overall functioning of our web application.

To convert the GUI-based AWS setup to a command-line version, we will need to use the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) to perform the necessary tasks. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

WEB TIER:

Step 1: Creating Your VPC and More

To create a VPC and subnets:

```shell
# Create VPC
aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block <vpc-cidr-block> --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=vpc,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=<vpc-name>}]'

# Create public subnets
aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id <vpc-id> --cidr-block <public-subnet-cidr-block> --availability-zone <availability-zone> --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=subnet,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=<public-subnet-name>}]'
aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id <vpc-id> --cidr-block <public-subnet-cidr-block> --availability-zone <availability-zone> --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=subnet,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=<public-subnet-name>}]'

# Create private subnets
aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id <vpc-id> --cidr-block <private-subnet-cidr-block> --availability-zone <availability-zone> --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=subnet,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=<private-subnet-name>}]'
aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id <vpc-id> --cidr-block <private-subnet-cidr-block> --availability-zone <availability-zone> --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=subnet,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=<private-subnet-name>}]'
aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id <vpc-id> --cidr-block <private-subnet-cidr-block> --availability-zone <availability-zone> --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=subnet,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=<private-subnet-name>}]'
aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id <vpc-id> --cidr-block <private-subnet-cidr-block> --availability-zone <availability-zone> --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=subnet,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=<private-subnet-name>}]'

# Create NAT gateway
aws ec2 create-nat-gateway --subnet-id <public-subnet-id> --allocation-id <eip-allocation-id> --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=natgateway,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=<nat-gateway-name>}]'
```

Step 2: Creating Your Web Tier Launch Template

To create a launch template for the web tier:

```shell
# Create launch template
aws ec2 create-launch-template --launch-template-name <web-tier-launch-template-name> --launch-template-data file://web-tier-launch-template.json
```

Note: You need to create a JSON file named "web-tier-launch-template.json" with the required launch template configuration.

Step 3: Create Auto Scaling Group

To create an auto scaling group for the web tier:

```shell
# Create auto scaling group
aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name <web-tier-auto-scaling-group-name> --launch-template "LaunchTemplateName=<web-tier-launch-template-name>,Version=<version>" --min-size 2 --max-size 5 --target-group-arns <target-group-arn> --vpc-zone-identifier "<private-subnet-1>,<private-subnet-2>"
```

APPLICATION TIER:

**ChatGPT:**

I apologize, but as a text-based AI model, I am unable to create visual diagrams. However, I can provide you with a textual representation of the AWS system architecture based on the information provided:

```scss
------------------------------------------
|               INTERNET                 |
------------------------------------------
                    |
             [Application Load Balancer]
                    |
------------------------------------------
|          WEB TIER (Public Subnets)     |
------------------------------------------
         |                      |
[Web Instance 1]        [Web Instance 2]
         |                      |
------------------------------------------
|      APPLICATION TIER (Private Subnets)|
------------------------------------------
         |                      |
[App Instance 1]        [App Instance 2]
         |                      |
------------------------------------------
|        DATABASE TIER (Private Subnets) |
------------------------------------------
                 |
           [RDS Instance]
```

In this diagram, the web tier consists of two instances (Web Instance 1 and Web Instance 2) running in public subnets. These instances are behind an Application Load Balancer, which distributes traffic to the instances.

The application tier consists of two instances (App Instance 1 and App Instance 2) running in private subnets. These instances process the data received from the web tier.

The database tier includes an RDS instance running in a private subnet. This is where the application tier interacts with the database.

Please note that this is a simplified representation, and additional components like security groups, routing tables, and NAT gateways are required to ensure proper network connectivity and security.
