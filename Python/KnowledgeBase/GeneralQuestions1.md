## General Python Questions

### Object-Oriented Programming 

A  set of short answer questions with answers to thoroughly test knowledge of Python object-oriented programming and please number them as well. 

> What is object-oriented programming (OOP)?

OOP is a programming paradigm that models real-world objects as software objects. It emphasizes encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

> What is a class in Python OOP?

A class is a blueprint for creating objects that defines attributes and behaviors of an object.

> What is an object in Python OOP?

An object is an instance of a class that has its own identity, state, and behavior.

> What is encapsulation in Python OOP?

Encapsulation is the practice of hiding the internal details of an object and providing a public interface for accessing and manipulating the object.

> What is inheritance in Python OOP?

Inheritance is the process of creating a new class by inheriting the attributes and methods of an existing class.

> What is polymorphism in Python OOP?

Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. In Python, it can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

> What is method overriding in Python OOP?

Method overriding is the process of redefining a method in a subclass that was already defined in its superclass.

> What is method overloading in Python OOP?

Method overloading is the process of defining multiple methods with the same name but with different parameters in a class.

> What is a constructor in Python OOP?

A constructor is a special method in a class that is called when an object is created. It initializes the object's state.

> What is a destructor in Python OOP?

A destructor is a special method in a class that is called when an object is destroyed. It is used to perform cleanup operations before the object is deleted from memory.

Create a  set of short answer questions with answers to thoroughly test knowledge of Python class functions such as __new__, __init__, __eeq__, __repr__, and __str__   and please number them as well. 

> What is the purpose of the __new__ method in a Python class?

The __new__ method is used to create and return a new instance of a class. It is responsible for allocating memory and returning the newly created instance.

> What is the purpose of the __init__ method in a Python class?

The __init__ method is used to initialize the instance variables of a class. It is called after the __new__ method has created the instance and is responsible for setting any default values or values based on parameters passed to the constructor.

> What is the purpose of the __eq__ method in a Python class?

The __eq__ method is used to define the equality comparison between two instances of a class. It should return True if the two instances are equal and False otherwise.

> What is the purpose of the __repr__ method in a Python class?

The __repr__ method is used to define the string representation of an instance of a class. It should return a string that represents the instance in a way that is unambiguous and can be used to recreate the instance.

> What is the purpose of the __str__ method in a Python class?

The __str__ method is used to define the string representation of an instance of a class. It should return a string that represents the instance in a way that is human-readable and descriptive.

> Do objects in Python have an identifier associated with them ? 

Yes, every object in Python has a unique identifier associated with it. This identifier can be obtained using the built-in id() function. The identifier is usually an integer that is guaranteed to be unique and constant for the lifetime of the object. It is assigned by the Python interpreter when the object is created and cannot be changed afterwards.

> How do you do a deep copy and shallow copy of a Python object? 

In Python, we can perform both shallow copy and deep copy of an object using the copy module.

> Shallow copy creates a new object which stores the reference of the original elements. 

A shallow copy doesn't create copies of nested objects, instead it just copies the reference to the original nested objects. We can use the copy() method or the copy.copy() function to perform a shallow copy.

Here's an example of shallow copy:

```python
import copy

list1 = [1, 2, [3, 4]]
list2 = copy.copy(list1)

print("Original list1: ", list1)
print("Shallow copied list2: ", list2)

# Modify the nested list in list2
list2[2][0] = 5

# Check the changes in both lists
print("After modifying list2: ")
print("list1: ", list1)
print("list2: ", list2)
```

Output:

```yaml
Original list1:  [1, 2, [3, 4]]
Shallow copied list2:  [1, 2, [3, 4]]
After modifying list2:
list1:  [1, 2, [5, 4]]
list2:  [1, 2, [5, 4]]
```

As we can see, when we modify the nested list in list2, the same changes are reflected in list1 because both lists are referencing the same nested list.

Deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies the original objects, including all nested objects. We can use the deepcopy() method or the copy.deepcopy() function to perform a deep copy.

Here's an example of deep copy:

```python
import copy

list1 = [1, 2, [3, 4]]
list2 = copy.deepcopy(list1)

print("Original list1: ", list1)
print("Deep copied list2: ", list2)

# Modify the nested list in list2
list2[2][0] = 5

# Check the changes in both lists
print("After modifying list2: ")
print("list1: ", list1)
print("list2: ", list2)
```

Output:

```yaml
Original list1:  [1, 2, [3, 4]]
Deep copied list2:  [1, 2, [3, 4]]
After modifying list2:
list1:  [1, 2, [3, 4]]
list2:  [1, 2, [5, 4]]
```

As we can see, when we modify the nested list in list2, the changes are not reflected in list1 because both lists have their own copy of the nested list.

---
> Can we compare two objects to see if they are the same? 

In Python, we can compare two objects to see if they are the same by using the is operator. The is operator compares the object identity, which means it checks if two objects are the same object in memory.

For example:

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
c = [1, 2, 3]

print(a is b) # Output: True
print(a is c) # Output: False
```

In the above example, a and b are two names pointing to the same list object in memory, so a is b returns True. On the other hand, a and c are two different list objects in memory, even though they contain the same elements, so a is c returns False.

> The data stored within the scope of an object is called 'attributes' ? How does one control access to attributes? 

Yes, the data stored within the scope of an object is called attributes.

Access to attributes in Python objects can be controlled using access modifiers such as public, private, and protected.

However, unlike some other programming languages, Python does not have built-in access modifiers. By convention, attributes that are intended to be private are named with a leading underscore, and attributes that are intended to be very private are named with two leading underscores.

In general, access to attributes is controlled through getter and setter methods, which can provide validation or transformation of the data being accessed. However, in Python, it is also possible to access attributes directly if they are marked as public.

> What are 'decorators' and the '@' symbol? What are property decorators? 

In Python, a decorator is a function that modifies the behavior of another function or class. Decorators are indicated by the '@' symbol, followed by the name of the decorator function. When applied to a function or class, the decorator function is executed first, and it modifies the original function or class in some way.

One type of decorator in Python is the property decorator. The property decorator is used to define a class attribute as a property. Properties are special methods that allow us to define getters, setters, and deleters for a class attribute.

For example, let's say we have a class called Rectangle with a private attribute called _width. We can define a property decorator for _width as follows:

```ruby
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, width):
        self._width = width
        
    @property
    def width(self):
        return self._width
        
    @width.setter
    def width(self, value):
        if value <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Width must be positive")
        self._width = value
```

In this example, the @property decorator is used to define the width attribute as a property with a getter method. The @width.setter decorator is used to define a setter method for the width property. This allows us to control how the width attribute is accessed and modified.

> Besides property decorators are there other kinds of decorators? 

Yes, besides property decorators, there are many other kinds of decorators in Python. Decorators are functions that take another function as input, wrap it with additional functionality, and then return the resulting function. Some other common types of decorators in Python include:

- *Class decorators:** These are used to modify the behavior of classes. They take a class as input, modify it, and then return the modified class.

- **Function decorators:** These are used to modify the behavior of functions. They take a function as input, modify it, and then return the modified function.

- **Method decorators:** These are used to modify the behavior of methods. They take a method as input, modify it, and then return the modified method.

- **Parameter decorators:** These are used to modify the behavior of function parameters. They take a function as input, modify its parameters, and then return the modified function.

- **Exception decorators:** These are used to modify the behavior of exception handling. They take a function as input, wrap it in a try-except block, and then return the wrapped function.

The @ symbol is used to apply a decorator to a function, class, or method.

> Custom collection classes have special methods, what else makes them different? 

In addition to the special methods, custom collection classes can also have additional methods and attributes specific to their functionality. This allows for greater control over the behavior and operations of the collection, as well as customization for specific use cases. Custom collection classes can also implement specific protocols or interfaces, such as the Iterable protocol or the Mapping interface, to ensure compatibility with other parts of the codebase. Additionally, custom collection classes can provide optimized implementations for specific operations, which can improve performance for large datasets or frequent operations.

> What are the special methods for collection classes, and what do they do? 

Special methods, also known as magic or dunder methods, are used to define behavior for custom classes in Python. For collection classes, there are several special methods that can be defined to customize their behavior:

__len__(self): Defines the behavior of the built-in len() function for instances of the class.

__getitem__(self, key): Defines the behavior of the square bracket notation ([]) used for indexing and slicing.

__setitem__(self, key, value): Defines the behavior of the square bracket notation ([]) used for assignment.

__delitem__(self, key): Defines the behavior of the del statement when used to delete an item from the collection.

__iter__(self): Defines the behavior of the iter() function for instances of the class.

__next__(self): Defines the behavior of the next() function for instances of the class when used in conjunction with __iter__().

__contains__(self, item): Defines the behavior of the in operator for instances of the class.

__add__(self, other): Defines the behavior of the + operator for instances of the class.

__sub__(self, other): Defines the behavior of the - operator for instances of the class.

__mul__(self, other): Defines the behavior of the * operator for instances of the class.

__eq__(self, other): Defines the behavior of the == operator for instances of the class.

__ne__(self, other): Defines the behavior of the != operator for instances of the class.

__lt__(self, other): Defines the behavior of the < operator for instances of the class.

__gt__(self, other): Defines the behavior of the > operator for instances of the class.

__le__(self, other): Defines the behavior of the <= operator for instances of the class.

__ge__(self, other): Defines the behavior of the >= operator for instances of the class.

__repr__(self): Defines the behavior of the built-in repr() function for instances of the class.

__str__(self): Defines the behavior of the built-in str() function for instances of the class.

By defining these special methods, custom collection classes can be made to behave like built-in collection types such as lists, dictionaries, and sets.

> What are 'generator' functions and methods? 

A generator in Python is a special type of function that generates an iterable sequence of values using the yield statement. When a generator function is called, it returns an iterator object without actually executing the function's code. The code inside the generator function is only executed when an element is requested from the iterator.

Here's an example of a generator function that generates the first n even numbers:

```python
def even_numbers(n):
    for i in range(2, 2*n+1, 2):
        yield i
```

You can use a generator function to create a generator object and iterate over its values like this:

```scss
gen = even_numbers(5)
for num in gen:
    print(num)
```

This will output:

```
2
4
6
8
10
```

In addition to generator functions, Python also provides generator expressions, which are similar to list comprehensions, but generate a generator object instead of a list. Here's an example:

```python
gen = (x**2 for x in range(5))
for num in gen:
    print(num)
```

This will output:

```
0
1
4
9
16
```

Generator functions and expressions are useful when you need to generate a sequence of values on-the-fly without creating a full list or other collection in memory. They can also be used to process large datasets efficiently, as you can generate and process each value one-at-a-time instead of loading the entire dataset into memory at once.

> Sometimes code is described as Pythonic, what does this mean? (in contrast to code that is not 'pythonic') 

When code is described as "Pythonic", it means that it follows the idioms and guidelines of the Python programming language. Python has a distinct style that emphasizes readability, simplicity, and brevity. Pythonic code is code that is written in a way that is natural and clear in Python, taking advantage of its features and language constructs to create efficient and concise code.

In contrast, code that is not Pythonic may be written in a way that is overly complicated, verbose, or difficult to read. It may not take advantage of Python's built-in data types or control structures, or it may use syntax or techniques that are not idiomatic in Python.

Adhering to Pythonic coding practices can make code easier to read, maintain, and debug, and can make it more efficient and expressive.

> So what are key elements and practices of writing Pythonic code? 
There are several key elements and practices of writing Pythonic code:

Using built-in functions and modules: Python has a large standard library that provides many built-in functions and modules that can simplify code and make it more Pythonic. For example, using list comprehensions instead of for loops, or using the built-in functions map(), filter(), and reduce() instead of loops.

Following PEP 8 guidelines: PEP 8 is the official style guide for Python code, and following its guidelines can make code more readable and consistent. This includes using four spaces for indentation, limiting line length to 79 characters, and using meaningful variable and function names.

Using Pythonic idioms: Python has several idioms that are considered more Pythonic than alternative approaches. For example, using context managers with the with statement instead of try/finally blocks, using the ternary operator for simple if/else statements, and using the * operator to unpack arguments.

Writing clear and concise code: Python code should be easy to read and understand. This means avoiding unnecessary complexity, using descriptive variable names, and writing comments to explain non-obvious code.

Embracing dynamic typing and duck typing: Python is dynamically typed, which means that variables can change type during runtime. This allows for more flexibility in programming and encourages the use of duck typing, where the type of an object is less important than its behavior and the methods it supports.

Overall, writing Pythonic code means embracing the unique features and philosophies of the Python language to write code that is concise, readable, and easy to understand.

### PEP 8 Guidelines

Write a series of short answer questions (and answers) to thoroughly test on the PEP 8 guidelines.

> What is PEP 8?

PEP 8 is the official style guide for writing Python code.

> What is the purpose of PEP 8?

The purpose of PEP 8 is to provide guidelines for Python code to make it more readable and consistent across projects.

> What are some key recommendations of PEP 8?

Some key recommendations of PEP 8 include:

- Using comments to explain poorly written code
- How can PEP 8 be enforced in a project?
- PEP 8 can be enforced in a project by using automated tools such as linters and code formatters, as well as by establishing code review processes to ensure adherence to the guidelines.

> What does one call Python map(), filter(), and reduce()? 

map(), filter(), and reduce() are built-in functions in Python that operate on iterables such as lists, tuples, and sets. They are collectively known as higher-order functions.

---
### Higher-Order Functions 

> Write a series of short answer questions (and answers) to thoroughly test on Python higher-order functions. 

> What are higher-order functions in Python?

Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as input parameters or return functions as output values.

> What is the difference between map() and filter() functions in Python?

The map() function applies a given function to each item of an iterable and returns an iterator of the results.

The filter() function applies a given function to each item of an iterable and returns an iterator of the items that pass the condition specified by the function.

> How can you define a lambda function in Python?

A lambda function is defined using the keyword lambda followed by the arguments and a colon, and then the expression to be evaluated. For example, lambda x: x**2 defines a lambda function that takes an input parameter x and returns the square of x.

> What is the purpose of the reduce() function in Python?

The reduce() function is used to apply a function to the first two items of an iterable, then to the result and the next item, and so on until all items have been processed. The final result is a single value that is returned by the function.

> How can you sort a list of dictionaries in Python?

You can use the sorted() function with a key parameter that specifies the field by which to sort. For example, sorted(list_of_dicts, key=lambda x: x['field']) will sort the list of dictionaries by the value of the 'field' key in each dictionary.

> What is the difference between the key and cmp parameters of the sorted() function in Python?

The key parameter specifies a function that is used to extract a sort key from each item in the iterable. The cmp parameter is used to compare two items directly and return a negative, zero, or positive value depending on their order. The key parameter is more flexible and recommended over the cmp parameter.

> What is the purpose of the any() and all() functions in Python?

- The any() function returns True if at least one element of an iterable is true, and False otherwise.
- The all() function returns True if all elements of an iterable are true, and False otherwise.

> What is a closure in Python?

A closure is a function object that has access to variables in its enclosing lexical scope, even when the function is called outside that scope. This is achieved by creating a function within another function and returning the inner function.

> What is a decorator in Python?

A decorator is a function that takes another function as input, and returns a new function that usually extends or modifies the behavior of the original function. Decorators are used to add functionality to functions or methods without changing their source code.

> What is the purpose of the zip() function in Python?

The zip() function takes two or more iterables and returns an iterator of tuples, where each tuple contains the i-th element from each of the input iterables. The resulting iterator is truncated to the length of the shortest input iterable.

> Write a series of short answer questions (and answers) to thoroughly test on Python   list comprehensions 

> What is a list comprehension in Python?

A list comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python. It allows you to create a new list by applying an expression to each item in an iterable object.

> How is a list comprehension written in Python?

A list comprehension is written with square brackets containing an expression followed by a for loop and optional if clauses. For example: [i for i in range(10)].

> Can you use multiple for loops in a list comprehension?

Yes, you can use multiple for loops in a list comprehension. For example: [(i, j) for i in range(3) for j in range(2)].

> Can you use conditional statements in a list comprehension?

Yes, you can use conditional statements in a list comprehension. You can use the if keyword to filter items from the iterable. For example: [i for i in range(10) if i % 2 == 0].

> Can you use a list comprehension to create a list of tuples?

Yes, you can use a list comprehension to create a list of tuples. You can use the tuple() function to create tuples. For example: [(i, i**2) for i in range(5)].

> Can you use a list comprehension to flatten a nested list?

Yes, you can use a list comprehension to flatten a nested list. You can use a nested list comprehension to create a new list containing all the items from the nested list. For example: [item for sublist in nested_list for item in sublist].

> Can you use a list comprehension to create a list of dictionaries?

Yes, you can use a list comprehension to create a list of dictionaries. You can use curly braces to create dictionaries. For example: [{i: i**2} for i in range(5)].

> Can you use a list comprehension to create a list of sets?

Yes, you can use a list comprehension to create a list of sets. You can use curly braces to create sets. For example: [set([i, i**2]) for i in range(5)].

Write a series of short answer questions (and answers) to thoroughly test on  using context managers with the with statement instead of try/finally blocks of Python programs 

> What is a context manager in Python?

Answer: A context manager is an object that enables the management of resources, such as files or network connections, in a way that allows for automatic setup and cleanup.

> How do you define a context manager in Python?

Answer: A context manager can be defined using the with statement or by defining a class with __enter__() and __exit__() methods.

> What is the advantage of using a context manager over try/finally blocks?

Answer: Using a context manager with the with statement makes it easier to manage resources by automatically setting them up and cleaning them up. It also helps to avoid repetitive and error-prone boilerplate code.

> What is the syntax for using a context manager with the with statement?

Answer: The syntax for using a context manager with the with statement is as follows:

```csharp
with <context_manager> as <alias>:
    <body>
```

> What happens when a context manager is used with the with statement?

Answer: When a context manager is used with the with statement, it automatically sets up the resource before the block of code runs and cleans up the resource when the block of code is finished, even if an exception is raised.

> How does one create a custom context manager in Python?

Answer: To create a custom context manager in Python, you can define a class with __enter__() and __exit__() methods. The __enter__() method returns the resource, and the __exit__() method cleans up the resource.

> How can one handle exceptions raised within a with statement?

Answer: Exceptions raised within a with statement can be handled using the __exit__() method of the context manager. If an exception is raised within the with statement, the __exit__() method is called with the exception information, and the exception can be handled or re-raised as needed.



---
### Duck Typing 

Write a series of short answer questions (and answers) to thoroughly test on duck typing in Python.

> What is duck typing in Python?

Duck typing is a programming concept where the type or class of an object is less important than the methods and attributes it possesses.

> What is the principle behind duck typing?

The principle behind duck typing is "If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck."

> What is an example of duck typing in Python?

An example of duck typing in Python is using the len() function on a list or a string. Both the list and the string are iterable and have a length, so the function can be used on either without needing to check their type.

> How is duck typing different from traditional typing?
In traditional typing, the type of an object is explicitly declared and strictly enforced. In duck typing, the type is not explicitly declared, and the object's suitability is determined by the presence of specific methods and attributes.

> What is the advantage of using duck typing in Python?
The advantage of using duck typing in Python is that it allows for more flexible and dynamic programming, as it allows different objects to be used interchangeably as long as they have the same methods and attributes needed for a particular operation.

> What is the potential disadvantage of using duck typing in Python?

The potential disadvantage of using duck typing in Python is that it can lead to more runtime errors if the expected methods and attributes are not present in an object. This can make debugging more difficult.

> Can duck typing be used with all types of objects in Python?

No, duck typing works best with objects that are dynamic and flexible, such as lists, dictionaries, and user-defined classes. It may not work well with objects that are more static and rigidly defined, such as built-in numeric types.

---
### Dictionaries 

Write a series of short answer questions (and answers) to thoroughly test on iterating over and accessing the elements of a dictionary.

> What is a dictionary in Python?

Answer: A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs in Python.

> How do you define an empty dictionary?

Answer: An empty dictionary can be defined using the following syntax: my_dict = {} or my_dict = dict().

> How do you access the value associated with a specific key in a dictionary?

Answer: You can access the value associated with a specific key in a dictionary using the key as an index. For example, my_dict["key"] would return the value associated with the key "key".

> What happens if you try to access a key that does not exist in a dictionary?

Answer: If you try to access a key that does not exist in a dictionary, a KeyError will be raised.

> How do you add a key-value pair to a dictionary?

Answer: You can add a key-value pair to a dictionary using the following syntax: my_dict[key] = value.

> How do you remove a key-value pair from a dictionary?

Answer: You can remove a key-value pair from a dictionary using the del statement. For example, del my_dict[key] would remove the key-value pair with the key "key" from the dictionary.

> How do you iterate over the keys in a dictionary?

Answer: You can iterate over the keys in a dictionary using the keys() method. For example, for key in my_dict.keys(): would iterate over the keys in the my_dict dictionary.

> How do you iterate over the values in a dictionary?

Answer: You can iterate over the values in a dictionary using the values() method. For example, for value in my_dict.values(): would iterate over the values in the my_dict dictionary.

> How do you iterate over both the keys and values in a dictionary?

Answer: You can iterate over both the keys and values in a dictionary using the items() method. For example, for key, value in my_dict.items(): would iterate over both the keys and values in the my_dict dictionary.

> Can you have duplicate keys in a dictionary?

Answer: No, you cannot have duplicate keys in a dictionary. If you attempt to add a key that already exists, the previous value associated with that key will be overwritten.

### JSON-like Constructs 

Write a series of short answer questions (and answers) to thoroughly test on iterating over and accessing the elements of JSON-like constructs of lists and dictionaries embedded within each other. 

> What is a JSON-like construct?

A JSON-like construct is a data structure that is similar to JSON but may not necessarily follow the strict syntax rules of JSON.

> What is the difference between a list and a dictionary in a JSON-like construct?

A list is an ordered collection of elements, while a dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.

> How can you access the value of a specific key in a dictionary within a JSON-like construct?

You can access the value of a specific key in a dictionary by using the square bracket notation followed by the key name, for example: my_dict['key_name'].

> How can you access the elements of a list within a JSON-like construct?

You can access the elements of a list by using the square bracket notation followed by the index number, for example: my_list[0].

> How can you iterate over the elements of a list of dictionaries within a JSON-like construct?

You can use a nested loop, first iterating over the list, then iterating over the keys in each dictionary, for example:

```rust
for my_dict in my_list:
    for key in my_dict:
        print(my_dict[key])
```

> How can you iterate over the keys and values of a dictionary within a JSON-like construct?

You can use the .items() method of the dictionary, for example:

```scss
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(key, value)
```

> How can you check if a key exists in a dictionary within a JSON-like construct?

You can use the in keyword followed by the dictionary and the key name, for example: if 'key_name' in my_dict:.

> How can you add a new key-value pair to a dictionary within a JSON-like construct?

You can use the square bracket notation followed by the new key name and assign it a value, for example: my_dict['new_key'] = 'new_value'.

> How can you remove a key-value pair from a dictionary within a JSON-like construct?

You can use the del keyword followed by the dictionary and the key name, for example: del my_dict['key_to_remove'].

> How can you convert a JSON-like construct to a JSON string in Python?

You can use the json.dumps() function, for example: json.dumps(my_data).

--- 
The most used Python ORM is called SQLAlchemy, right? 

Yes, SQLAlchemy is one of the most popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries for Python.

Write a series of short answer questions (and answers) to thoroughly test the use of SQLAlchemy in Python programs.

> What is SQLAlchemy in Python?

SQLAlchemy is a popular Object Relational Mapper (ORM) that provides a set of high-level API to connect Python code to relational databases and perform database operations.

> What are the different components of SQLAlchemy?

SQLAlchemy consists of two main components:

Core: A SQL abstraction layer that allows for communication with relational databases using SQL expressions.

ORM: A high-level Object Relational Mapper that provides a way to interact with databases using Python classes and objects.

> What is the difference between SQLAlchemy Core and SQLAlchemy ORM?

The main difference between the two is the level of abstraction they provide. While Core provides a low-level interface for communicating with databases using SQL, ORM provides a high-level interface for working with databases using Python objects.

> What is the advantage of using an ORM like SQLAlchemy?

ORM provides a way to interact with databases using high-level Python objects, which makes it easier to write and read data from a database. Additionally, ORM provides a level of abstraction from the underlying database, which allows for easier maintenance of code and reduces the likelihood of SQL injection attacks.

> How do you create a connection to a database using SQLAlchemy?

To create a connection to a database using SQLAlchemy, you need to specify the database type, username, password, host, and database name using a connection string. You can then create an instance of the create_engine class provided by SQLAlchemy, passing the connection string as an argument.

> What is an ORM model in SQLAlchemy?

In SQLAlchemy, an ORM model is a Python class that represents a database table. Each attribute of the class represents a column in the table, and each instance of the class represents a row in the table.

> How do you define an ORM model in SQLAlchemy?

To define an ORM model in SQLAlchemy, you need to create a Python class that inherits from the declarative_base class provided by SQLAlchemy. You then define the attributes of the class to represent the columns of the table, using the Column class provided by SQLAlchemy.

> What is a session in SQLAlchemy?

In SQLAlchemy, a session is a transactional environment used to interact with the database. It provides a way to query, insert, update, and delete rows in the database, and also manages the transaction lifecycle.

> How do you create a session in SQLAlchemy?

To create a session in SQLAlchemy, you first need to create an instance of the Session class provided by the orm module. You then use the sessionmaker function to bind the session to the database engine created using the create_engine function.

> What is a query in SQLAlchemy?

In SQLAlchemy, a query is an object used to fetch data from the database. It provides a way to filter, order, group, and join tables in the database.

### Web Pages

If you are constructing web pages with Python, what tools do you use? Jinja template engine? DOM? Markdown? 

> When constructing web pages with Python, commonly used tools include:

Flask or Django web frameworks
Jinja2 template engine for rendering HTML templates
HTML/CSS for page layout and styling
JavaScript and DOM manipulation for client-side interactivity
Markdown for authoring content (which can be converted to HTML using a library like Markdown2)

> Is it possible to construct web pages from Markdown and Jinja2 template engine ? 

Yes, it is possible to construct web pages from Markdown and Jinja2 template engine. Markdown can be used to write content in a simple and easy-to-read format, while Jinja2 can be used to create dynamic HTML templates that can be populated with data from Python code. By combining these tools, developers can quickly create static web pages or more complex web applications with dynamic content.

> So where where is the CSS and styling added? By Jinja2? 

No, Jinja2 is a template engine that allows you to generate dynamic HTML pages. CSS and styling are typically added using CSS files, which are linked to the HTML page using the <link> tag in the HTML <head> section. Alternatively, inline styles can be added using the style attribute in HTML tags.

> Is there a Python package to generate inline CSS from Tradewinds CSS ? 

I'm not familiar with a Python package specifically for generating inline CSS from Tradewinds CSS, but it is possible to use various CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation within a Python web framework to generate HTML with styling. It is also possible to use CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less to generate CSS from a higher-level syntax.

What is Foundation? 

> Foundation is a front-end framework that provides a responsive grid system, a set of UI elements, and a number of other features that help to build web applications and websites quickly and efficiently. It is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to work with a variety of back-end languages, including Python. Foundation is open source and maintained by ZURB, a design agency.

> What styles of Markdown are supported by Python libraries? 

The styles of Markdown supported by Python libraries vary depending on the specific library used. However, the most common styles supported include basic Markdown syntax such as headers, lists, emphasis, and links, as well as extensions like tables, fenced code blocks, and footnotes. Some Python Markdown libraries also support additional features like syntax highlighting, task lists, and definition lists.

> Which Python Markdown libraries are the best to use? 

There are several Python Markdown libraries available, each with its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the specific use case. Here are a few popular ones:

Markdown: This is the original implementation of Markdown by John Gruber. It's lightweight and easy to use, but lacks some of the more advanced features of other Markdown libraries.

Markdown2: This is a Python implementation of Markdown that includes many of the advanced features missing in the original implementation, such as tables and footnotes.

Mistune: This is a fast and full-featured Markdown parser in pure Python, with support for extensions such as syntax highlighting and task lists.

CommonMark: This is a robust and standardized Markdown parser that adheres closely to the CommonMark specification. It's fully compatible with the original Markdown syntax, but also includes several extensions.

Ultimately, the best Markdown library to use depends on your specific needs and preferences.

> Which applications and systems use CommonMark ? 

CommonMark is a standardized version of the Markdown language that has been adopted by various applications and systems. Some of the notable ones are:

- GitHub
- GitLab
- Stack Overflow
- Reddit
- Discourse
- Hugo (a static website generator)
- Jekyll (a static website generator)
- Pelican (a static website generator)
- Ghost (a blogging platform)
- Write.as (a minimalist writing platform)
- Typora (a markdown editor)

> What features does CommonMark have? 

CommonMark is a specification for the Markdown markup language. It aims to provide a standardized syntax for Markdown and a consistent output across different implementations. Some of the key features of CommonMark include:

A strict specification: CommonMark defines a strict specification for Markdown, which ensures consistent rendering of Markdown across different systems.

Support for basic formatting: CommonMark supports basic formatting features such as headings, lists, bold, italic, and code blocks.

Extensibility: CommonMark allows for the creation of custom syntax extensions, which can add new formatting elements or modify the behavior of existing elements.

Compatibility with other Markdown flavors: CommonMark is designed to be compatible with other Markdown flavors, such as GitHub Flavored Markdown and Markdown Extra.

Specification of edge cases: CommonMark defines the behavior of Markdown in edge cases, such as the handling of nested lists and link reference definitions.

Overall, CommonMark aims to provide a consistent and reliable specification for the Markdown markup language, making it easier for developers and users to work with Markdown across different systems and applications.
