## Hacker Rank

- [Basic Questions]()
- [Difficult Intermediate]() 

[HackerRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HackerRank) is a technology company that focuses on competitive programming challenges for both consumers and businesses. 
Developers compete by writing programs according to provided specifications. 
HackerRank's programming challenges can be solved in a variety of programming languages (including Java, C++, PHP, Python, SQL, JavaScript) 
and span multiple computer science domains.

HackerRank categorizes most of their **programming challenges** into a number of **core computer science domains**, 
including the **management of databases, mathematics, artificial intelligence,** among other subjects.

When a programmer submits a solution to a programming challenge, 
their submission is scored on the accuracy of their output. 
Programmers are then **ranked globally on the HackerRank leaderboard** 
and earn badges based on their accomplishments, which is intended 
to drive competition among users. 

In addition to individual coding challenges, HackerRank also hosts contests 
(often referred to by HackerRank as "CodeSprints") where users compete 
on the same programming challenges during a set period of time 
and are then ranked at the conclusion of the event. 

HackerRank is part of the growing **gamification trend** within competitive 
computer programming. The consumer-side of their website is free for coders to use.
