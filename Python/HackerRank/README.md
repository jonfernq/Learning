## Hacker Rank

[HackerRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HackerRank) is a technology company that focuses on competitive programming challenges for both consumers and businesses. 
Developers compete by writing programs according to provided specifications. 
HackerRank's programming challenges can be solved in a variety of programming languages (including Java, C++, PHP, Python, SQL, JavaScript) 
and span multiple computer science domains.

HackerRank categorizes most of their **programming challenges** into a number of **core computer science domains**, 
including the **management of databases, mathematics, artificial intelligence,** among other subjects.

When a programmer submits a solution to a programming challenge, 
their submission is scored on the accuracy of their output. 
Programmers are then **ranked globally on the HackerRank leaderboard** 
and earn badges based on their accomplishments, which is intended 
to drive competition among users. 

In addition to individual coding challenges, HackerRank also hosts contests 
(often referred to by HackerRank as "CodeSprints") where users compete 
on the same programming challenges during a set period of time 
and are then ranked at the conclusion of the event. 

HackerRank is part of the growing **gamification trend** within competitive 
computer programming. The consumer-side of their website is free for coders to use.

Could you provide some example questions from the basics test?

Here are some example questions that you might find on the "problem-solving basic" test on HackerRank:

Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints "Even" if the number is even or "Odd" if the number is odd.

Write a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list.

Write a program that takes two strings as input and concatenates them together, separated by a space.

Write a program that takes a string as input and prints the reverse of the string.

Write a function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list with all the strings sorted in alphabetical order.

These questions are designed to test a candidate's understanding of basic programming concepts like conditional statements, loops, functions, and string manipulation. The actual questions on the test may vary depending on the specific version of the "problem-solving basic" test being used.


Please provide some examples of the most difficult questions on the intermediate Python  test.

Write a program that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of all the pairs of integers in the list that sum up to a target value.

Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the length of the longest substring that contains only unique characters.

Write a program that takes a list of dictionaries representing students and their test scores, and returns a dictionary containing the average score for each subject.

Write a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the median value.

Write a program that simulates a game of Blackjack, with a human player and a computer dealer.
