## Hacker Rank: Basic Coding Challenges

> Could you provide some example questions from the basics test?

Here are some example questions that you might find on the "problem-solving basic" test on HackerRank:

1. Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints "Even" if the number is even or "Odd" if the number is odd.

2. Write a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list.

4. Write a program that takes two strings as input and concatenates them together, separated by a space.

5. Write a program that takes a string as input and prints the reverse of the string.

6. Write a function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list with all the strings sorted in alphabetical order.

These questions are designed to test a candidate's understanding of basic programming concepts like conditional statements, loops, functions, and string manipulation. The actual questions on the test may vary depending on the specific version of the "problem-solving basic" test being used.
