> <div>My bicycle rear tire keeps getting a flat right after i change the inner tube without anything on the outside penetrating the tire. What is wrong? is something pentrating from the inside? </div>

If you keep experiencing repeated flats on your bicycle's rear tire immediately after changing the inner tube, it's possible that there is something inside the tire causing the problem. Here are a few potential issues to consider:

1. Rim tape: Check the condition of the rim tape, which is a protective strip that lines the rim's inner edge. If the rim tape is damaged, worn out, or improperly installed, it can expose the inner tube to the spoke holes or sharp edges of the rim, leading to flats. Ensure that the rim tape is in good condition and properly covering the spoke holes.
    
2. Debris or foreign objects: Inspect the inside of the tire thoroughly for any debris, small stones, glass shards, or other foreign objects that may be embedded in the tire. Even tiny objects can cause repeated flats if they are not removed.
    
3. Burrs or sharp edges: Check the inside of the tire for any burrs, sharp edges, or rough spots that could potentially puncture the inner tube. Run your hand along the inside surface of the tire to feel for any irregularities.
    
4. Spoke nipples: Pay attention to the spoke nipples, which are the small nuts that secure the spokes to the rim. If they protrude too far into the rim, they can puncture the inner tube. Verify that the spoke nipples are properly recessed or covered with rubber or plastic washers.
    
5. Tire liner or strip: Consider using a tire liner or strip between the tire and the inner tube. These protective layers can provide an additional barrier against punctures. They are typically made of durable materials like Kevlar or nylon and can be installed easily.
    

By thoroughly examining these potential issues, you should be able to identify the cause of the repeated flats. Additionally, ensure that you are using the correct size and type of inner tube for your tire, and follow proper inflation guidelines to prevent flats caused by pinch flats or underinflation.
