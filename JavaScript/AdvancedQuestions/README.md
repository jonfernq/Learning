Answer: A) 6

7. What is the output of this code?

let y = { name: "bar" };
let z = x;
z.name = "baz";
console.log(x.name);
```

B) bar
C) baz
D) undefined

Answer: C) baz

8. What is the output of this code?

```javascript

let y = [4, 5, 6];
let z = [...x, ...y];
console.log(z.length);
```

A) 3
B) 4
C) 5
D) 6

Answer: D) 6

9. What is the output of this code?

```javascript
function foo() {
  console.log(this);
}

let obj = { name: "bar" };
let baz = foo.bind(obj);
baz.call(6);
```

A) undefined
B) window
C) { name: "bar" }
D) { name: "foo" }

Answer: C) { name: "bar" }

10. What is the output of this code?

```javascript
function foo() {
  let x = 1;
  function bar() {
    let x = 2;
    function baz() {
      let x = 3;
      console.log(x);
    }
    baz();
    console.log(x);
  }
  bar();
  console.log(x);
}
foo();
```

A) 1, 2, 3
B) 3, 2, 1
C) 1, 1, 1
D) 3, 3, 3

Answer: B) 3, 2, 1

**Explanations:**

1. The output is 6 because the array destructuring syntax swaps the values of x, y, and z. So x becomes 3, y becomes 1, and z becomes 2. Then the sum of x + y + z is 6.

2. The output is { name: "bar" } because the arrow function inherits the this value from the outer scope, which is set by the call method to obj. So the console.log(this) prints the obj object.

3. The output is 6 because assigning a value to an index that is out of bounds of an array creates a sparse array with empty slots. The length property of an array reflects the highest index plus one, not the number of elements. So arr.length is 5 + 1 = 6.

4. The output is 3 because the bind method returns a new function that has a preset argument of 1. So when bar(2) is called, it is equivalent to foo(1, 2), which returns 1 + 2 = 3.

5. The output is true because the template literal syntax creates a string that is identical to the concatenation of x and y. So z === x + y evaluates to true.

6. The output is 9 because the parameters of the foo function are passed by value, not by reference. So changing the values of a, b, and c inside the function does not affect the values of x, y, and z outside the function. The sum of x + y + z is still 1 + 2 + 3 = 9.

7. The output is baz because the variables x and z point to the same object in memory. So changing the name property of z also changes the name property of x. The console.log(x.name) prints baz.

8. The output is 6 because the spread operator (...) creates a new array that contains all the elements of x and y. The length of z is 3 + 3 = 6.

9. The output is { name: "bar" } because the bind method returns a new function that has a fixed this value of obj. So calling baz with any other value of this does not change the this value inside foo. The console.log(this) prints obj.

10. The output is 3, 2, 1 because the variable x is declared with let in each scope, creating a new binding for each x. The console.log(x) prints the value of x in the closest scope. So baz prints 3, bar prints 2, and foo prints 1.
