## Grouping and Aggregates 

> What types of SQL statements are used to aggregate data for analysis? 

There are several types of SQL statements that are commonly used to aggregate data for analysis:

**SELECT with GROUP BY:** This statement is used to group rows in a table based on one or more columns, and then apply an aggregate function such as SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX or MIN to each group.

**HAVING:** This statement is used to filter the groups produced by a GROUP BY statement based on a condition that involves an aggregate function.

**SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, and MIN:** These are aggregate functions that are used to perform calculations on groups of rows. SUM adds up the values in a column, AVG calculates the average of the values, COUNT counts the number of rows, MAX finds the highest value, and MIN finds the lowest value.

**DISTINCT:** This statement is used to eliminate duplicate rows from a result set, which can be useful when working with aggregated data.

**ORDER BY:** This statement is used to sort the rows in a result set based on one or more columns, which can be useful when analyzing the data.

By using these SQL statements in combination, you can perform a wide variety of data analysis tasks, such as calculating totals, averages, and other summary statistics, identifying trends and patterns in the data, and filtering and sorting the data to extract insights.

### Example #1

> Please provide a simple example of 'GROUP BY' and 'ORDER BY' used together, as they always seem to be used. 

Here's a simple example of using GROUP BY and ORDER BY together:

Suppose you have a table named "sales" with columns "product", "region", and "sales_amount". You want to find the total sales amount for each product and region, and sort the results in descending order by the total sales amount.

You can use the following SQL statement to achieve this:

```vbnet
SELECT product, region, SUM(sales_amount) as total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY product, region
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

In this statement, we're selecting the "product", "region", and "SUM(sales_amount)" columns from the "sales" table. The SUM function is used to calculate the total sales amount for each product and region combination. We're also giving this calculated column an alias "total_sales" using the "as" keyword.

We're then using the GROUP BY clause to group the results by the "product" and "region" columns, which means that the SUM function is applied separately for each combination of product and region.

Finally, we're using the ORDER BY clause to sort the results in descending order by the "total_sales" column, which means that the product-region combinations with the highest total sales amount will appear first in the result set.

> Please write a simple Python program to demonstrate the use of the above SQL statement with some example data.  

Here's an example Python program that uses the SQL statement I provided earlier to calculate the total sales amount for each product and region combination in a sample "sales" table:

```python
import sqlite3

# Create a sample "sales" table with some data
conn = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')  # create an in-memory database for testing
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute('CREATE TABLE sales (product text, region text, sales_amount real)')
cur.execute('INSERT INTO sales VALUES ("Product A", "Region 1", 100.0)')
cur.execute('INSERT INTO sales VALUES ("Product A", "Region 2", 200.0)')
cur.execute('INSERT INTO sales VALUES ("Product B", "Region 1", 150.0)')
cur.execute('INSERT INTO sales VALUES ("Product B", "Region 2", 250.0)')
cur.execute('INSERT INTO sales VALUES ("Product C", "Region 1", 50.0)')
cur.execute('INSERT INTO sales VALUES ("Product C", "Region 2", 100.0)')
conn.commit()

# Execute the SQL statement to calculate total sales by product and region
cur.execute('SELECT product, region, SUM(sales_amount) as total_sales FROM sales GROUP BY product, region ORDER BY total_sales DESC')

# Print the results
for row in cur.fetchall():
    print(row)
```

In this program, we're creating an in-memory SQLite database and populating it with some sample sales data. We're then executing the SQL statement I provided earlier using the execute method of the SQLite cursor object. We're then iterating over the rows of the result set using the fetchall method and printing them to the console.

When you run this program, it should output the following:

```python
('Product A', 'Region 2', 200.0)
('Product B', 'Region 2', 250.0)
('Product B', 'Region 1', 150.0)
('Product A', 'Region 1', 100.0)
('Product C', 'Region 2', 100.0)
('Product C', 'Region 1', 50.0)
```

This is the result set produced by the SQL statement, which shows the total sales amount for each product and region combination, sorted in descending order by the total sales amount.

### Example #2

> Suppose you have a database table of customer purchases with customer id, date of purchase, and amount as fields.
Please write an SQL query to list all purchases including these three fields, grouping and ordering by customer id and purchase date

Here's an SQL query that should do what you've described:

```vbnet
SELECT customer_id, purchase_date, amount
FROM customer_purchases
GROUP BY customer_id, purchase_date, amount
ORDER BY customer_id, purchase_date;
```

In this query, we're selecting the "customer_id", "purchase_date", and "amount" columns from the "customer_purchases" table. We're then using the GROUP BY clause to group the results by "customer_id" and "purchase_date", which means that we'll see each unique combination of customer and purchase date in the results.

Finally, we're using the ORDER BY clause to order the results first by "customer_id" and then by "purchase_date". This means that the results will be ordered first by customer ID and within each customer ID, the purchases will be ordered by date.

---
> Please write a Python program with example data read from a file to demonstrate this query.  

Here's an example Python program that reads data from a file and executes the SQL query to group and order the customer purchases by customer ID and purchase date:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('customer_purchases.db')
c = conn.cursor()

# Create the customer_purchases table
c.execute('''CREATE TABLE customer_purchases
             (customer_id INT, purchase_date TEXT, amount FLOAT)''')

# Read the data from a file and insert it into the customer_purchases table
with open('customer_purchases_data.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        values = line.strip().split(',')
        c.execute('INSERT INTO customer_purchases VALUES (?, ?, ?)', (int(values[0]), values[1], float(values[2])))

# Execute the SQL query to group and order the customer purchases by customer ID and purchase date
c.execute('''SELECT customer_id, purchase_date, amount
             FROM customer_purchases
             GROUP BY customer_id, purchase_date, amount
             ORDER BY customer_id, purchase_date''')

# Print the results
for row in c:
    print(row)

# Close the database connection
conn.close()
```

In this program, we're creating a SQLite database named "customer_purchases.db" and a table named "customer_purchases" with the columns "customer_id", "purchase_date", and "amount".

We're then reading data from a file named "customer_purchases_data.txt" that contains comma-separated values for customer ID, purchase date, and amount. We're inserting this data into the "customer_purchases" table using the "INSERT INTO" SQL statement.

Finally, we're executing the SQL query to group and order the customer purchases by customer ID and purchase date. We're then printing the results to the console using a for loop.

--- 
> Please create some data for customer_purchases_data.txt

Here's an example of what the data in customer_purchases_data.txt might look like:

```
1,2022-01-01,100.00
1,2022-02-01,75.00
1,2022-02-15,25.00
2,2022-01-10,50.00
2,2022-03-01,150.00
3,2022-02-14,200.00
3,2022-03-01,125.00
3,2022-03-10,75.00
```

This data represents purchases made by three customers, with their corresponding IDs, purchase dates, and amounts. You can use this data to test the SQL query and Python program I provided earlier.
