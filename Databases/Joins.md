## SQL Joins


> What is the definition of an SQL join? 

In SQL, a join is a way to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. The related column is typically a primary key in one table and a foreign key in another table. The join operation creates a new result set by combining columns from the two tables based on the join condition.

There are several types of joins in SQL, including inner join, left join, right join, full outer join, and cross join. Each type of join produces a different result set based on how the tables are joined.

An inner join returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables based on the join condition. A left join returns all the rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. A right join returns all the rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table. A full outer join returns all the rows from both tables, including the non-matching rows. A cross join returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, which means that every row from one table is paired with every row from the other table.

Joins are a powerful tool in SQL that allow you to combine data from multiple tables to gain insights and answer complex questions. By using joins, you can avoid duplicating data in your database and ensure that your data is well-organized and easy to work with.

> Please list the different kinds of SQL joins. 

There are several types of SQL joins, including:

**Inner Join:** This type of join returns only the matching rows between two tables based on a specified condition. The resulting table will contain only the rows that have matching values in both tables.

**Left Join:** This type of join returns all the rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table based on a specified condition. If there is no matching row in the right table, the result will contain NULL values for the columns from the right table.

**Right Join:** This type of join is similar to the Left Join but returns all the rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table based on a specified condition. If there is no matching row in the left table, the result will contain NULL values for the columns from the left table.

**Full Outer Join:** This type of join returns all the rows from both tables, including the unmatched rows from each table. If there is no match, the result will contain NULL values for the columns from the other table.

**Cross Join:** This type of join returns the Cartesian product of both tables, i.e., all possible combinations of rows between both tables. It does not require a join condition.

**Self Join:** This type of join is used when a table is joined with itself based on a common column, such as a foreign key. It allows you to compare the rows within the same table.

It is worth noting that the syntax and specific implementation of these joins may vary slightly depending on the particular SQL dialect or database management system being used.

> Is this also the order of their frequency of use? 

No, the order of the frequency of use of SQL joins can vary depending on the specific use case and the data being queried.

In general, Inner joins are likely the most frequently used type of SQL join, as they are used to retrieve only the matching rows from two tables based on a specific condition. Left and Right joins are also commonly used, as they allow you to retrieve all the rows from one table and the matching rows from another table.

Full Outer joins and Cross joins are less commonly used, as they can produce large and potentially unwieldy results. Self joins are used in specific cases where a table needs to be joined to itself, such as when comparing hierarchical data or when analyzing network data.

However, it is important to note that the frequency of use of SQL joins can vary depending on the specific use case and the data being queried. Different data scenarios may require different types of joins to produce the desired results, and the specific use case will dictate which join types are most appropriate.

> Please provide a simple example of an Inner Join.

Here's a simple example of an Inner Join in SQL:

Let's say we have two tables: "Customers" and "Orders". The "Customers" table contains information about each customer, including their customer ID, name, and email address. The "Orders" table contains information about each order, including the order ID, customer ID (which corresponds to the customer who placed the order), and the date the order was placed.

To retrieve information about the customers who have placed orders, we can use an Inner Join between the "Customers" and "Orders" tables. Here's an example SQL query that does this:

```sql
SELECT Customers.Name, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```

In this query, we're selecting the customer's name from the "Customers" table and the order date from the "Orders" table. We're joining the two tables on the "CustomerID" column, which is common to both tables. The result of this query will be a table that contains only the rows where there is a matching customer ID in both tables.

This Inner Join will only return the rows where there is a match between the "CustomerID" column in the "Customers" table and the "CustomerID" column in the "Orders" table. This means that the resulting table will only contain information about customers who have placed orders, and any customers who have not placed an order will not be included in the result.

---
> Please provide an example of a left join.

Sure! Here's an example of a Left Join in SQL:

Let's use the same two tables as in the Inner Join example: "Customers" and "Orders". This time, we want to retrieve all the customers from the "Customers" table, including those who have not placed an order yet. To do this, we can use a Left Join between the "Customers" and "Orders" tables. Here's an example SQL query that does this:

```sql
SELECT Customers.Name, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```

In this query, we're selecting the customer's name from the "Customers" table and the order date from the "Orders" table. We're joining the two tables on the "CustomerID" column, which is common to both tables. However, this time we're using a Left Join instead of an Inner Join. This means that we're selecting all the rows from the "Customers" table, including those that do not have a matching customer ID in the "Orders" table. If there is no matching row in the "Orders" table, the result will contain NULL values for the columns from the "Orders" table.

The result of this query will be a table that contains all the customers from the "Customers" table, including those who have not placed an order yet. If a customer has placed an order, the order date will be displayed in the "OrderDate" column. If a customer has not placed an order, the "OrderDate" column will contain NULL.

This Left Join allows us to retrieve all the rows from the "Customers" table, even if there is no matching row in the "Orders" table. This can be useful when we want to see a list of all customers and their orders, but we also want to include customers who have not placed an order yet.

---
> Please provide an example of a Right Join.

Sure! Here's an example of a Right Join in SQL:

Let's again use the same two tables as in the Inner Join and Left Join examples: "Customers" and "Orders". This time, we want to retrieve all the orders from the "Orders" table, including those that do not have a matching customer ID in the "Customers" table. To do this, we can use a Right Join between the "Customers" and "Orders" tables. Here's an example SQL query that does this:

```sql
SELECT Customers.Name, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Customers
RIGHT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```

In this query, we're selecting the customer's name from the "Customers" table and the order date from the "Orders" table. We're joining the two tables on the "CustomerID" column, which is common to both tables. However, this time we're using a Right Join instead of an Inner Join or Left Join. This means that we're selecting all the rows from the "Orders" table, including those that do not have a matching customer ID in the "Customers" table. If there is no matching row in the "Customers" table, the result will contain NULL values for the columns from the "Customers" table.

The result of this query will be a table that contains all the orders from the "Orders" table, including those that do not have a matching customer ID in the "Customers" table. If an order has a matching customer ID in the "Customers" table, the customer's name will be displayed in the "Name" column. If an order does not have a matching customer ID in the "Customers" table, the "Name" column will contain NULL.

This Right Join allows us to retrieve all the r
ows from the "Orders" table, even if there is no matching row in the "Customers" table. This can be useful when we want to see a list of all orders and the customers who placed them, but we also want to include orders that do not have a matching customer ID in the "Customers" table.

---
> Please provide an example of a Full Outer Join.

Sure! Here's an example of a Full Outer Join in SQL:

Let's again use the same two tables as in the previous examples: "Customers" and "Orders". This time, we want to retrieve all the customers and all the orders, including those that do not have a matching customer ID in the other table. To do this, we can use a Full Outer Join between the "Customers" and "Orders" tables. Here's an example SQL query that does this:

```sql
SELECT Customers.Name, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Customers
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```

In this query, we're selecting the customer's name from the "Customers" table and the order date from the "Orders" table. We're joining the two tables on the "CustomerID" column, which is common to both tables. However, this time we're using a Full Outer Join instead of an Inner Join, Left Join, or Right Join. This means that we're selecting all the rows from both the "Customers" and "Orders" tables, including those that do not have a matching customer ID in the other table. If there is no matching row in the other table, the result will contain NULL values for the columns from that table.

The result of this query will be a table that contains all the customers and all the orders, including those that do not have a matching customer ID in the other table. If a customer has placed an order, the order date will be displayed in the "OrderDate" column. If a customer has not placed an order, the "OrderDate" column will contain NULL. Similarly, if an order has a matching customer ID in the "Customers" table, the customer's name will be displayed in the "Name" column. If an order does not have a matching customer ID in the "Customers" table, the "Name" column will contain NULL.

This Full Outer Join allows us to retrieve all the rows from both tables, even if there is no matching row in the other table. This can be useful when we want to see a complete list of all customers and all orders, and we also want to include customers who have not placed an order yet and orders that do not have a matching customer ID in the "Customers" table.

> Please provide an example of a Cross Join.

Here's an example of a Cross Join in SQL:

Let's say we have two tables: "Employees" and "Departments". The "Employees" table has columns "EmployeeID" and "Name", while the "Departments" table has columns "DepartmentID" and "DepartmentName". We want to generate a list of all possible combinations of employees and departments. To do this, we can use a Cross Join between the "Employees" and "Departments" tables. Here's an example SQL query that does this:

```sql
SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DepartmentName
FROM Employees
CROSS JOIN Departments;
```

In this query, we're selecting the employee's name from the "Employees" table and the department name from the "Departments" table. We're using the Cross Join operator to combine every row from the "Employees" table with every row from the "Departments" table, resulting in a complete list of all possible combinations of employees and departments.

The result of this query will be a table that contains all possible combinations of employees and departments. For example, if there are 5 employees and 3 departments, the result will contain 15 rows, with each employee listed alongside ---

> Note that a Cross Join can result in a very large result set if the tables being joined are large. Therefore, it's important to use Cross Joins with care and only 
when necessary.

---
> Please provide an example of a Self Join.

Here's an example of a Self Join:

A self join is a join in which a table is joined with itself. To demonstrate a self join, let's say we have a table called "Employees" with the following columns: "EmployeeID", "Name", and "ManagerID". The "ManagerID" column contains the ID of the employee's manager, which refers to another row in the same table. We want to retrieve the name of each employee and the name of their manager. To do this, we can use a Self Join between the "Employees" table and join it with itself based on the "ManagerID" column. Here's an example SQL query that does this:

```vbnet
SELECT e1.Name AS EmployeeName, e2.Name AS ManagerName
FROM Employees e1
INNER JOIN Employees e2
ON e1.ManagerID = e2.EmployeeID;
```

In this query, we're joining the "Employees" table with itself based on the "ManagerID" column. We're aliasing the table as "e1" and "e2" to distinguish between the two instances of the "Employees" table. We're selecting the name of each employee (aliased as "EmployeeName") and the name of their manager (aliased as "ManagerName"). We're joining the table on the condition that the "ManagerID" of one row matches the "EmployeeID" of another row, which means that the row with the "ManagerID" is the manager of the row with the "EmployeeID".

The result of this query will be a table that lists the name of each employee and the name of their manager. If an employee has no manager (i.e., their "ManagerID" is NULL), they will not appear in the result.

This Self Join allows us to retrieve information from a table that refers to itself. It can be useful in cases where a table contains hierarchical data, such as organizational charts or family trees.
