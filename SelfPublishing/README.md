## Self-Publishing

Questions geared towards: 1. where to host one's writing (e.g. GitHub), and 2. how to work it into material published on a website (e.g. Git Pages) or in book form (e.g. at Leanpub).

> How do Leanpub, Gitbook and Sphinx / ReadTheDocs compare? 

Leanpub, GitBook, and Sphinx/ReadTheDocs are all tools that allow authors to write and publish their own books or documentation, but they differ in their approach, features, and target audience.

**Leanpub** is primarily designed for self-publishing and focuses on providing a simple and flexible platform for authors to write and publish their books, with features such as in-progress publishing, support for exercises and quizzes, and a built-in storefront for selling books directly to readers. Leanpub also provides a range of tools and services to help authors market and promote their books, including email marketing and affiliate programs.

**GitBook** is a similar platform that is geared more towards documentation and technical writing, with a focus on collaborative writing and publishing. GitBook allows multiple authors to collaborate on a single project, and offers features such as version control, commenting, and analytics to help authors track and improve their documentation.

**Sphinx/ReadTheDocs**, on the other hand, is a tool specifically designed for generating technical documentation from source code, with a focus on ease of use and flexibility. Sphinx allows authors to write documentation in reStructuredText or Markdown, and can automatically generate HTML, PDF, and other output formats. ReadTheDocs is a hosting service for Sphinx-generated documentation, providing features such as custom domains, analytics, and integration with version control systems like GitHub.

Overall, while all three tools provide similar basic functionality for writing and publishing books or documentation, they differ in their approach and target audience, with Leanpub focused on self-publishing, GitBook on collaborative writing, and Sphinx/ReadTheDocs on generating documentation from code.

> Do they all provide free hosting like GitHub does ? 

GitBook and Sphinx/ReadTheDocs both provide free hosting for documentation and books that are published on their platforms.

**GitBook** allows users to create unlimited public and private repositories for free, with up to 2GB of storage and unlimited bandwidth. There are also paid plans available with additional features and more storage.

**Sphinx/ReadTheDocs** also offers free hosting for open source projects, allowing users to publish their documentation and books online for free. There are also paid plans available for private projects or for users who need more advanced features or additional support.

However, Leanpub does not provide free hosting in the same way as GitHub or the other platforms. While authors can publish their books on Leanpub and distribute them directly to readers, Leanpub does not host the books themselves. Instead, authors are responsible for hosting their own book files and providing download links to readers. Leanpub does offer a built-in storefront and payment processing system for selling books directly to readers, but authors are responsible for hosting and distributing their own book files.

> Do the above have restrictions on hosted content of books and sites, such as only tech documentation ? 

The types of content that can be hosted on GitBook, Sphinx/ReadTheDocs, and Leanpub depend on the terms of service of each platform. While these platforms are primarily designed for technical documentation and self-publishing, there are generally no restrictions on the types of content that can be hosted, as long as the content does not violate the platform's terms of service.

For example, GitBook's terms of service prohibit the hosting of "offensive, pornographic, defamatory, or illegal content," but otherwise allow any type of content to be hosted on the platform. Similarly, Sphinx/ReadTheDocs prohibits the hosting of "offensive, pornographic, defamatory, or illegal content," but otherwise allows any type of technical documentation to be hosted.

As for Leanpub, there are no specific content restrictions, but authors are responsible for ensuring that their content does not violate any copyright or intellectual property laws, and must comply with Leanpub's terms of service regarding content and conduct.

Overall, while these platforms are primarily designed for technical documentation and self-publishing, there are generally no restrictions on the types of content that can be hosted, as long as the content does not violate the platform's terms of service or any applicable laws.
