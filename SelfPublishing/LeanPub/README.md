> So what is Leanpub? 

Leanpub is a self-publishing platform designed for independent authors who want to create and sell books, courses, and other digital content. Founded in 2010, it offers a simple and streamlined process for authors to write, publish, and market their work online.

One of the key features of Leanpub is its "Lean Publishing" approach, which emphasizes the iterative and collaborative nature of the writing process. Authors can publish their work in-progress and receive feedback from readers, which they can use to improve the content before finalizing and publishing it.

Leanpub also offers a range of tools and features to help authors create and distribute their content, including a simple Markdown-based writing interface, automated formatting and publishing to multiple formats (e.g. PDF, EPUB, MOBI), built-in marketing and promotional tools, and the ability to sell content directly to readers or through online retailers such as Amazon and Apple.

Overall, Leanpub aims to provide a platform for authors to create and sell high-quality digital content on their own terms, with a focus on simplicity, flexibility, and collaboration.

> Can you also publish to Amazon off of Leanpub? 

Yes, authors can publish their books on Amazon through Leanpub. After writing and formatting their book on Leanpub, authors can use the platform's built-in publishing tools to generate a Kindle-compatible MOBI file, which they can then upload to Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) platform.

Additionally, Leanpub also offers the ability to publish print-on-demand (POD) books through Amazon's CreateSpace service, which allows authors to create physical copies of their book that are printed and shipped on demand as orders are received. Authors can use Leanpub to generate a print-ready PDF file of their book, which they can then upload to CreateSpace to create and sell physical copies.

Overall, Leanpub offers a range of publishing options for authors, including both digital and physical formats, and the ability to sell their books through a variety of online retailers.

> So does Leanpub provide more complete self-publishing facilities than alternatives? for instance, I heard that you can use Canva to self-publish ebooks.

Leanpub and Canva are both tools that can be used for self-publishing, but they offer different features and capabilities.

Canva is primarily a design tool that allows users to create graphics, social media posts, marketing materials, and other visual content using pre-made templates and a drag-and-drop interface. While Canva does offer some basic ebook templates and the ability to export designs as PDFs, it does not provide the same level of functionality for creating and publishing ebooks as Leanpub.

In contrast, Leanpub is specifically designed for self-publishing books and other written content, and offers a range of tools and features to support the entire publishing process, from writing and formatting to publishing and selling. Some of the key features that Leanpub provides include:

- 1. A simple and flexible writing interface based on the Markdown language
- 2. Automated ebook formatting for multiple formats (PDF, EPUB, MOBI) and platforms (Kindle, iBooks, etc.)
- 3. The ability to publish in-progress and receive feedback from readers
- 4. Built-in marketing and promotional tools, including email campaigns, discount codes, and affiliate programs
- 5. The ability to sell content directly to readers or through online retailers such as Amazon and Apple

Overall, while Canva can be a useful tool for creating graphics and visual content, it does not offer the same level of functionality or support for self-publishing books as Leanpub.

> What version of Markdown does Leanpub use? 

Leanpub uses a custom version of the Markdown language called "Leanpub-flavored Markdown" (LFM), which includes some additional features and syntax beyond the standard Markdown specification.

Some of the key differences between LFM and standard Markdown include:

- 1. The ability to include "Leanpub-specific" elements such as exercises, quizzes, and solutions
- 2. The use of double braces ({{ }}) to indicate Leanpub-specific elements and commands
- 3. The ability to specify metadata such as book title, author, and copyright information using special syntax
- 4. The use of a special syntax for footnotes and endnotes
- 5. Support for inserting images, videos, and other media types

Overall, LFM is designed to provide a simple and flexible writing format that is optimized for self-publishing on Leanpub. However, it is still based on the core principles and syntax of the standard Markdown language, so users who are familiar with Markdown should find it relatively easy to learn and use.

> I have been using GitHub as a writing platform, is it difficult to reformat GitHub markdown to Leanpub markdown ? 

Reformatting Markdown from GitHub to Leanpub should be relatively straightforward, as both platforms use a similar syntax and structure for writing and formatting text. However, there may be some differences in the specific syntax and features that are supported by each platform, so you may need to make some manual adjustments to your Markdown files to ensure that they are compatible with Leanpub.

Some of the key differences between GitHub-flavored Markdown (GFM) and Leanpub-flavored Markdown (LFM) include:

- 1. LFM supports additional syntax for Leanpub-specific elements, such as exercises, quizzes, and solutions. You will need to add this syntax to your Markdown files if you want to include these elements in your Leanpub book.
- 2. LFM uses a different syntax for specifying metadata such as book title, author, and copyright information. You will need to update these fields in your Markdown files using the appropriate LFM syntax.
- 3. LFM supports some additional syntax for footnotes and endnotes that is not available in GFM. You may need to adjust your Markdown files to use the correct syntax for these elements in Leanpub.
- 4. LFM may have some limitations or differences in the way it handles certain types of media, such as images, videos, or code snippets. You may need to check the Leanpub documentation to ensure that these elements are formatted correctly.

Overall, while there may be some differences between GFM and LFM, the underlying Markdown syntax is largely the same, so you should be able to convert your existing Markdown files to LFM with minimal effort.

> Is Leanpub the leading self-publishing platform? What are its competitors? 

Leanpub is a popular self-publishing platform that offers a range of tools and features for authors who want to write, format, and publish their own books. However, it is not necessarily the leading self-publishing platform, as there are a number of other competitors in the space that offer similar features and functionality.

Some of the main competitors to Leanpub include:

- **Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP):** Amazon's self-publishing platform allows authors to publish and sell their ebooks on the Kindle platform, as well as in print through Amazon's CreateSpace service.
- **Smashwords:** This platform allows authors to publish and distribute their ebooks to multiple retailers, including Amazon, Apple iBooks, and Barnes & Noble.
- **Draft2Digital:** Similar to Smashwords, Draft2Digital allows authors to publish and distribute their ebooks to multiple retailers, with a focus on ease of use and simplicity.
- **Reedsy:** This platform offers a range of tools and services for authors, including book editing, cover design, and formatting, as well as distribution and promotion services.

While Leanpub has a number of unique features and benefits that set it apart from its competitors, such as its focus on "in-progress" publishing and its support for exercises and quizzes, there are many other platforms available for authors to choose from depending on their specific needs and goals.

> So if there is no hosting of books on their website, what does Leanpub do and where does it do it? Does it provide facilities for assembling an ebook from raw text files? Where does this take place, on the site or one's own machine ? 

Leanpub provides a platform for authors to write and publish their own ebooks, but as you mentioned, it does not host the book files itself. Instead, Leanpub provides a set of tools and services to help authors write, format, and publish their books, and authors are responsible for hosting and distributing their own book files.

The Leanpub platform includes a simple, web-based text editor that allows authors to write their books using Markdown syntax. Authors can then use Leanpub's tools to format and publish their books in various formats, including PDF, EPUB, and MOBI.

When an author publishes a book on Leanpub, they can choose to make it available for sale through the Leanpub storefront, which includes a payment processing system and options for setting the price of the book. Authors can also choose to distribute their books for free or to use external platforms such as Amazon to sell their books.

To create the various ebook formats, Leanpub provides a "book generator" tool that authors can use to assemble their book from the raw text files. The book generator is a command-line tool that authors can run on their own machines to generate the various ebook formats. Leanpub also provides a preview feature that allows authors to see how their book will look in various formats before publishing it.

Overall, while Leanpub does not host the book files itself, it provides a range of tools and services to help authors write and publish their own ebooks, and authors are responsible for hosting and distributing their own book files.
