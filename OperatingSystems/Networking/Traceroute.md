## Traceroute command

The Linux traceroute command is used to trace the route that a packet takes to reach a destination host on the network. It works by sending packets with increasing Time to Live (TTL) values and recording the responses from the intermediate routers. This way, it can show the path and the delay of each hop¹²³.

The traceroute command can be useful for troubleshooting network connectivity issues, identifying network bottlenecks, and measuring network latency. You can also use various options and switches with traceroute command to customize your tests and get more information¹²³..
