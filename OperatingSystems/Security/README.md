> What is the notion of 'exploit in computer security?

- In computer security, an exploit refers to a technique or program that takes advantage of a vulnerability or weakness in a computer system or software application in order to gain unauthorized access, perform a malicious action, or cause a denial of service. Exploits can target a variety of components, including operating systems, network protocols, web applications, and even hardware.

Once an exploit successfully takes advantage of a vulnerability, it can potentially give an attacker full control of the affected system or application. Exploits can be created by attackers themselves, or they can be obtained from public or private exploit databases. Therefore, it is important for system administrators and software developers to constantly monitor for new exploits and to apply patches and updates to address vulnerabilities as soon as they are discovered.

> What is the relation between 'penetration testing' and 'exploits' ?

- Penetration testing and exploits are related in the sense that penetration testing involves the use of exploits as a means to test the security of a system or application.

Penetration testing is a method of evaluating the security of a computer system or network by simulating an attack from a malicious source. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could be exploited by an attacker. In order to simulate an attack, penetration testers use a variety of tools and techniques, including exploits.

Exploits are pieces of code or software that take advantage of a vulnerability or weakness in a system or application to gain unauthorized access, perform malicious actions, or take control of the system. Penetration testers use exploits to determine whether a system or application is vulnerable to attack and to identify weaknesses that need to be addressed.

Overall, while exploits are just one tool used in penetration testing, they play a crucial role in identifying vulnerabilities and helping organizations improve their overall security posture.

> What are some  public or private exploit databases ?
 
There are several public and private exploit databases available, including: 
1. Exploit Database ([https://www.exploit-db.com/](https://www.exploit-db.com/) ) - a public database of exploits maintained by Offensive Security. 
2. National Vulnerability Database ([https://nvd.nist.gov/](https://nvd.nist.gov/) ) - a database maintained by NIST that contains information on known vulnerabilities. 
3. Metasploit Framework ([https://www.metasploit.com/](https://www.metasploit.com/) ) - an open-source tool used for penetration testing that includes a database of known exploits. 
4. ZeroDay Initiative ([https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/) ) - a program run by Trend Micro that offers financial incentives for researchers to report vulnerabilities and exploits. 
5. VulnDB ([https://vulndb.cyberriskanalytics.com/](https://vulndb.cyberriskanalytics.com/) ) - a commercial vulnerability intelligence platform that provides access to a database of vulnerabilities and exploits. 
6. ExploitHub ([https://exploithub.com/](https://exploithub.com/) ) - a commercial platform that offers access to a database of exploits for use in penetration testing and other security testing. 
7. PacketStorm Security ([https://packetstormsecurity.com/](https://packetstormsecurity.com/) ) - a public database of exploits, vulnerabilities, and security tools.

> There are varieties of 'hacking' that are considered good? Is this 'white' hacking?

Yes, the term "white hat hacking" or "ethical hacking" is used to describe the practice of hacking with the intention of improving or securing computer systems and networks. White hat hackers often work for organizations to identify and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors. Other forms of hacking, such as "black hat hacking" or "cracking," involve using hacking techniques for illegal or unethical purposes.

> Hacking seems to be a different skill set then 'security' as a topic taught in university computer science courses?

Hacking and security are related but distinct areas in computer science. Hacking is the act of identifying and exploiting weaknesses in computer systems or networks for unauthorized access or malicious purposes. On the other hand, security focuses on protecting computer systems and networks from unauthorized access, attacks, and other security threats.

University computer science courses typically cover the principles and techniques of computer security, including cryptography, network security, secure coding, and security policies and regulations. These courses aim to provide students with the knowledge and skills needed to design and implement secure computer systems and networks.

While hacking skills can be useful in security, it's important to note that ethical hacking, also known as "white hat" hacking, involves using hacking techniques for legitimate purposes, such as identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks. It's essential to use hacking techniques ethically and responsibly to prevent harm to computer systems and networks.

> Where does one learn 'white hacking' ? It does not seem to be taught in universities or textbooks.

> There are many resources available online to learn about ethical hacking or "white hat" hacking. Some popular options include online courses, tutorials, and certifications from organizations such as CompTIA, EC-Council, and Offensive Security. There are also many books available on the topic, both in print and online, as well as forums and communities where individuals can share knowledge and learn from others. It's important to note that while learning about ethical hacking can be a valuable skill, it should always be done within legal and ethical boundaries.

> Are there ethical hacking competitions, like Coder One ?

Yes, there are ethical hacking competitions that are held regularly. These competitions are aimed at promoting the skills and techniques required for ethical hacking and cybersecurity. Some popular ethical hacking competitions include: 
1. Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions: These competitions involve teams or individuals trying to find and exploit vulnerabilities in a simulated system or network. 
2. Hackathons: These are events that bring together developers, cybersecurity experts, and other professionals to work on specific challenges related to cybersecurity. 
3. Bug bounty programs: These are initiatives where companies offer rewards to individuals who find and report security vulnerabilities in their systems or applications. 
4. Cybersecurity challenges: These are contests or competitions that test the skills of participants in areas such as network security, cryptography, and penetration testing.

Examples of such competitions include DEF CON CTF, picoCTF, Hack the Box, and CyberPatriot.
