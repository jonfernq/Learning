## Scheduling Issues

> Please explain the differences between I/O-bound and CPU-bound tasks, and how these differences relate to CPU scheduling. 

I/O-bound and CPU-bound tasks are two types of tasks that can be executed on a computer system. The main difference between these two types of tasks is the type of resources they require.

An I/O-bound task is one that requires a lot of input/output (I/O) operations, such as reading from or writing to a disk, sending or receiving data over a network, or reading from or writing to a file. I/O-bound tasks typically spend a lot of time waiting for these I/O operations to complete, and their CPU usage is relatively low. Examples of I/O-bound tasks include downloading a large file from the internet or processing a large amount of data from a file.

On the other hand, a CPU-bound task is one that requires a lot of CPU resources, such as performing complex mathematical calculations, running a simulation, or encoding a video. CPU-bound tasks typically use the CPU intensively and for long periods of time, and they may not require many I/O operations. Examples of CPU-bound tasks include running a machine learning algorithm or rendering a 3D animation.

These differences between I/O-bound and CPU-bound tasks are important to consider when implementing CPU scheduling algorithms. In general, scheduling algorithms should aim to minimize the waiting time of a task while also ensuring fair allocation of CPU resources among all tasks. For I/O-bound tasks, it may be beneficial to use a scheduling algorithm that prioritizes tasks with pending I/O operations, so that these tasks can complete their I/O operations as quickly as possible. For CPU-bound tasks, a scheduling algorithm that prioritizes shorter tasks may be more effective, as these tasks may complete more quickly and allow other tasks to execute sooner.

Overall, the goal of CPU scheduling algorithms is to balance the use of CPU resources among all tasks in a way that maximizes overall system performance and responsiveness, taking into account the specific characteristics of the tasks being executed.

> Are there metrics that can be used to determine whether a balance has been achieved in, "the use of CPU resources among all tasks in a way that maximizes overall system performance and responsiveness." 

Yes, there are several metrics that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of CPU scheduling algorithms in achieving a balance in the use of CPU resources and maximizing system performance and responsiveness. Some of these metrics include:

CPU utilization: This metric measures the percentage of time the CPU is busy executing tasks. A high CPU utilization rate may indicate that the system is overloaded and that the scheduling algorithm needs to be adjusted to improve system performance.

- Throughput: This metric measures the number of tasks completed per unit of time. A high throughput rate indicates that the scheduling algorithm is efficient and that tasks are being executed quickly and effectively.

- Response time: This metric measures the time it takes for a task to receive a response from the system after it has been submitted. A low response time is desirable, as it indicates that tasks are being executed quickly and that the system is responsive.

- Turnaround time: This metric measures the time it takes for a task to complete from the time it was submitted. A low turnaround time is desirable, as it indicates that tasks are being executed quickly and that the system is efficient.

- Fairness: This metric measures how evenly the CPU resources are being allocated among tasks. A fair scheduling algorithm will ensure that each task receives a reasonable share of CPU resources, regardless of its priority or characteristics.

These metrics can be used to evaluate the performance of different CPU scheduling algorithms and to identify areas where improvements can be made. By monitoring these metrics over time, system administrators can optimize the scheduling algorithm to ensure that the system is running efficiently and effectively.

> How can one get these metrics on a Linux and Windows system? 

On Linux systems, there are several tools that can be used to obtain these metrics. Here are a few examples:

- CPU Utilization: The top command is a useful tool for monitoring CPU utilization in real-time. To display CPU usage, simply run the top command in a terminal window. The %CPU column displays the percentage of CPU time being used by each process.

- Throughput: To measure throughput, you can use the sar command, which is part of the sysstat package. The sar command can be used to collect and report system activity information, including disk I/O, CPU utilization, and network activity. To monitor disk I/O throughput, for example, you can use the sar -d command.

- Response Time and Turnaround Time: These metrics can be measured using the time command, which can be used to time the execution of a specific command or program. The time command reports the total time taken to execute the command, as well as the time spent in system and user modes.

On Windows systems, there are several built-in tools that can be used to obtain these metrics. Here are a few examples:

- CPU Utilization: To monitor CPU utilization in Windows, you can use the built-in Task Manager or the perfmon tool. To launch Task Manager, simply press Ctrl+Shift+Esc. The Performance tab displays real-time CPU utilization, as well as other system performance metrics.

- Throughput: To measure throughput, you can use the perfmon tool, which is built into Windows. The perfmon tool can be used to collect and report system performance data, including disk I/O, network activity, and CPU utilization.

- Response Time and Turnaround Time: These metrics can be measured using the Measure-Command cmdlet in PowerShell. The Measure-Command cmdlet can be used to time the execution of a specific command or script, and reports the total time taken to execute the command, as well as the time spent in user and kernel modes.

> Can the 'perfmon' tool be used from the Windows command prompt or Powershell?  

Yes, the perfmon tool can be used from the Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell.

To open perfmon from the Command Prompt, type perfmon and press Enter. This will launch the perfmon GUI.

To open perfmon from PowerShell, type perfmon.exe and press Enter. This will launch the perfmon GUI.

You can also use the logman command from the Command Prompt or PowerShell to create and manage performance counter logs. For example, to create a new performance counter log, you can use the following command:

```
logman create counter MyCounterLog -c "\Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time" -f csv
```

This command creates a new performance counter log named "MyCounterLog" that logs the percentage of processor time used by all processors. The log data is saved in CSV format.

Once you have created a performance counter log, you can use the typeperf command from the Command Prompt or PowerShell to view the logged data. For example, to view the logged data for the "MyCounterLog" log, you can use the following command:

```
typeperf "\MyCounterLog(*)\*"
```

This command displays all performance counter data in the "MyCounterLog" log. You can modify the command to display only specific counter data.

> There must be a whole discipline centered around system performance evaluation and achieving this balance. What is it called? And, what are some of the essential works in this field? 

The discipline that focuses on system performance evaluation and optimization is called performance engineering. Performance engineering involves designing, building, testing, and tuning systems to ensure that they meet their performance requirements and provide optimal performance under different workloads and conditions.

Some of the essential works in the field of performance engineering include:

- "Computer Performance Evaluation: Modelling Techniques and Tools" by C.J. Venter and E. Page.
- "Performance Analysis of Computer Networks" by Matthew N. O. Sadiku.
- "Performance by Design: Computer Capacity Planning By Example" by Daniel A. Menasce and Virgilio A.F. Almeida.
- "Benchmarking: An Essential Tool for Performance Improvement" by Mohamed El-Geish and Shaikh A. Abdus.
- "Performance Analysis and Tuning for General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU)" by Kai Zhao and Xiaohui Gu.

Additionally, there are many industry-standard tools and techniques used in performance engineering, including load testing, profiling, monitoring, and benchmarking, among others.

> Please explain the differences and priorities of 'interactive' and 'real-time' scheduling approaches.

Interactive and real-time scheduling are two different approaches used in CPU scheduling. The main differences between them lie in their priorities and their goals.

Interactive scheduling is focused on providing good performance and responsiveness for interactive applications, such as desktop applications, web browsers, and other interactive software. The goal of interactive scheduling is to ensure that interactive applications can respond quickly to user input, without experiencing significant delays or lag. Interactive scheduling is generally used in desktop and server environments, where the system is expected to support a mix of interactive and batch applications.

Real-time scheduling, on the other hand, is focused on meeting strict timing requirements for critical tasks in embedded systems, control systems, and other real-time applications. Real-time systems are designed to respond quickly to external events, such as sensor readings or control signals, and to perform calculations and other operations within strict timing constraints. The goal of real-time scheduling is to ensure that critical tasks can be executed on time, without being interrupted or delayed by other tasks. Real-time scheduling is commonly used in mission-critical applications, such as aerospace, defense, and medical systems.

In terms of priorities, interactive scheduling gives priority to interactive applications, whereas real-time scheduling gives priority to critical tasks. Interactive applications are usually given higher priority than background or batch processes, while real-time tasks are given the highest priority of all.

Overall, the main difference between interactive and real-time scheduling lies in their goals and priorities. Interactive scheduling is focused on providing good performance and responsiveness for interactive applications, while real-time scheduling is focused on meeting strict timing requirements for critical tasks.

Are there standard algorithms used for  'interactive' and 'real-time' scheduling approaches? 

Yes, there are standard algorithms used for interactive and real-time scheduling approaches.

For interactive scheduling, the most commonly used algorithm is the Round-Robin (RR) scheduling algorithm, which is a pre-emptive scheduling algorithm that gives each process a fixed time slice to execute before moving on to the next process. This algorithm is designed to provide good responsiveness for interactive applications by ensuring that each process gets a fair share of CPU time.

Other algorithms used for interactive scheduling include Priority Scheduling, Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling, and Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) Scheduling. These algorithms are designed to prioritize interactive applications over background or batch processes, and to provide better responsiveness and performance for interactive applications.

For real-time scheduling, there are several different algorithms that are commonly used, depending on the specific requirements of the system. These algorithms include:

- Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS): This algorithm assigns priorities to tasks based on their execution rate, with faster tasks given higher priority.

- Earliest Deadline First (EDF) Scheduling: This algorithm assigns priorities to tasks based on their deadlines, with tasks having earlier deadlines given higher priority.

- Fixed Priority Scheduling: This algorithm assigns fixed priorities to tasks, with higher-priority tasks preempting lower-priority tasks.

- Deadline Monotonic Scheduling: This algorithm assigns priorities to tasks based on their deadlines, with tasks having shorter deadlines given higher priority.

Overall, the specific algorithm used for interactive or real-time scheduling depends on the requirements of the system, the characteristics of the tasks being scheduled, and the performance goals of the system.
