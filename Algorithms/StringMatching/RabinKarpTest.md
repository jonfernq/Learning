**You:**

Could you help me set up testing with pytest for this 
Python version of the RabinKarp string matching algorithm: 

def hash(s):
    # A simple hash function that returns the sum of ASCII values of characters
    return sum(ord(c) for c in s)

def RabinKarp(T, P):
    n = len(T)
    m = len(P)
    hP = hash(P)
    
    for i in range(n - m + 1):
        hT = hash(T[i:i + m])
        
        if hT == hP:
            if T[i:i + m] == P:
                print("Pattern found at index", i)
    
    return

**ChatGPT:**

Certainly! I can help you set up testing with pytest for the Python version of the RabinKarp string matching algorithm. Here's how you can do it:

1. Install pytest:
    
    ```
    pip install pytest
    ```
    
2. Create a new Python file, let's call it `test_rabinkarp.py`, and open it in a text editor.
    
3. Import the necessary modules and functions:
    
    ```python
    from your_module import RabinKarp
    ```
    
4. Define the test cases using pytest decorators. For each test case, you'll need to provide an input string and the expected output. Here's an example:
    
    ```python
    import pytest
    
    @pytest.mark.parametrize("T, P, expected", [
        ("Hello, world!", "world", [7]),
        ("ababcababcabcabc", "abc", [2, 5, 8, 11, 14]),
        ("", "pattern", []),
    ])
    def test_rabinkarp(T, P, expected):
        result = []
        def callback(index):
            result.append(index)
        RabinKarp(T, P, callback)
        assert result == expected
    ```
    
    In this example, we have three test cases. The `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator allows you to define multiple test cases with different inputs and expected outputs. The test function `test_rabinkarp` calls the `RabinKarp` function and verifies that the actual output matches the expected output.
    
    Note that I added an additional `callback` parameter to the `RabinKarp` function in order to collect the indices where the pattern is found.
    
5. Save the file and run the tests:
    
    ```
    pytest test_rabinkarp.py
    ```
    
    pytest will automatically discover and run the tests defined in the file. It will provide you with the test results, indicating whether each test passed or failed.
    

That's it! You now have a pytest setup for testing the RabinKarp string matching algorithm. You can add more test cases as needed by extending the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator.
