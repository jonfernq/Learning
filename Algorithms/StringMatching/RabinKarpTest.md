## Testing Rabin Karp String Matching Algorithm

Please show me how to use pytest  in the simplest way possible.

**ChatGPT:**

Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use pytest in the simplest way possible:

1. Install pytest:
    
    ```
    pip install pytest
    ```
    
2. Create a new Python file in your desired directory. Let's call it `test_example.py`.
    
3. Write a simple test function using the `def` keyword and the prefix `test_`. For example:
    
    ```python
    def test_addition():
        assert 2 + 2 == 4
    
    def test_subtraction():
        assert 5 - 3 == 2
    ```
    
    These are two simple test functions. Each test function contains an assertion statement that checks if the specified condition is true. If the condition is true, the test passes. Otherwise, the test fails.
    
4. Save the file.
    
5. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `test_example.py` file is located.
    
6. Run pytest by entering the following command:
    
    ```
    pytest
    ```
    
    pytest will automatically discover and run all the test functions defined in files that match the naming convention `test_*.py`. In this case, it will find and execute the test functions in the `test_example.py` file.
    
7. View the test results in the terminal or command prompt. pytest will display a summary of the executed tests and indicate whether each test passed or failed.
    

That's it! You have now successfully used pytest in the simplest way possible. You can continue adding more test functions to the `test_example.py` file or create additional test files following the same naming convention (`test_*.py`). pytest will automatically discover and execute those tests when you run `pytest` in the terminal or command prompt.

Slightly more complex is when the Python code that you want to test is in a separate Python (.py) file that needs to be imported to the test file. Please write a simple example for this situation.

**ChatGPT:**

Certainly! Here's a simple example demonstrating how to test Python code in a separate file using pytest:

Let's assume we have two files in the same directory:

1. `math_operations.py` - Contains the code we want to test.
2. `test_math_operations.py` - Contains the pytest test cases.

`math_operations.py`:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b
```

`test_math_operations.py`:

```python
from math_operations import add, subtract

def test_addition():
    assert add(2, 2) == 4

def test_subtraction():
    assert subtract(5, 3) == 2
```

In this example, the `math_operations.py` file contains two functions, `add` and `subtract`, which we want to test. The `test_math_operations.py` file imports these functions using the `from math_operations import add, subtract` statement.

To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Install pytest if you haven't already:
    
    ```
    pip install pytest
    ```
    
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `test_math_operations.py` file is located.
    
3. Run pytest by entering the following command:
    
    ```
    pytest
    ```
    
    pytest will automatically discover and run the test functions defined in the `test_math_operations.py` file. It will import the necessary functions from the `math_operations.py` file to execute the tests.
    
4. View the test results in the terminal or command prompt. pytest will display a summary of the executed tests and indicate whether each test passed or failed.
    

That's it! You have now successfully tested Python code in a separate file using pytest. You can continue adding more test functions to the `test_math_operations.py` file or create additional test files to test other Python code files. Just make sure to import the necessary functions or modules from the file you want to test.

Could you help me set up testing with pytest for this 
Python version of the RabinKarp string matching algorithm: 

def hash(s):
    # A simple hash function that returns the sum of ASCII values of characters
    return sum(ord(c) for c in s)

def RabinKarp(T, P):
    n = len(T)
    m = len(P)
    hP = hash(P)
    
    for i in range(n - m + 1):
        hT = hash(T[i:i + m])
        
        if hT == hP:
            if T[i:i + m] == P:
                print("Pattern found at index", i)
    
    return

Certainly! I can help you set up testing with pytest for the Python version of the RabinKarp string matching algorithm. Here's how you can do it:

1. Install pytest:
    
    ```
    pip install pytest
    ```
    
2. Create a new Python file, let's call it `test_rabinkarp.py`, and open it in a text editor.
    
3. Import the necessary modules and functions:
    
    ```python
    from your_module import RabinKarp
    ```
    
4. Define the test cases using pytest decorators. For each test case, you'll need to provide an input string and the expected output. Here's an example:
    
    ```python
    import pytest
    
    @pytest.mark.parametrize("T, P, expected", [
        ("Hello, world!", "world", [7]),
        ("ababcababcabcabc", "abc", [2, 5, 8, 11, 14]),
        ("", "pattern", []),
    ])
    def test_rabinkarp(T, P, expected):
        result = []
        def callback(index):
            result.append(index)
        RabinKarp(T, P, callback)
        assert result == expected
    ```
    
    In this example, we have three test cases. The `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator allows you to define multiple test cases with different inputs and expected outputs. The test function `test_rabinkarp` calls the `RabinKarp` function and verifies that the actual output matches the expected output.
    
    Note that I added an additional `callback` parameter to the `RabinKarp` function in order to collect the indices where the pattern is found.
    
5. Save the file and run the tests:
    
    ```
    pytest test_rabinkarp.py
    ```
    
    pytest will automatically discover and run the tests defined in the file. It will provide you with the test results, indicating whether each test passed or failed.
    

That's it! You now have a pytest setup for testing the RabinKarp string matching algorithm. You can add more test cases as needed by extending the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator.
