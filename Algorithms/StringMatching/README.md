## String Matching

The Naive or Brute Force Algorithm for Pattern Searching is a simple algorithm that compares the pattern with all substrings of the text. The algorithm slides the pattern over the text one by one and checks for a match. If a match is found, it prints the index of the match in the text. The worst-case time complexity of this algorithm is O(m*(n-m+1)) where m is the length of the pattern and n is the length of the text. The best-case time complexity is O(n) when the first character of the pattern does not occur in the text².

The main drawback of this algorithm is its time complexity. It takes a lot of time to search for patterns in large texts. To improve its speed, we can use other algorithms such as KMP Algorithm for Pattern Searching, Rabin-Karp Algorithm for Pattern Searching, and Optimized Algorithm for Pattern Searching¹.

Pattern searching has many real-life applications such as searching for keywords in a document, searching for a specific string in a database, searching for a specific word in a book or article, and many more.

I hope this helps!
