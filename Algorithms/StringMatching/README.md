## String Matching

The Naive or Brute Force Algorithm for Pattern Searching is a simple algorithm that compares the pattern with all substrings of the text. The algorithm slides the pattern over the text one by one and checks for a match. If a match is found, it prints the index of the match in the text. The worst-case time complexity of this algorithm is O(m*(n-m+1)) where m is the length of the pattern and n is the length of the text. The best-case time complexity is O(n) when the first character of the pattern does not occur in the text².

The main drawback of this algorithm is its time complexity. It takes a lot of time to search for patterns in large texts. To improve its speed, we can use other algorithms such as KMP Algorithm for Pattern Searching, Rabin-Karp Algorithm for Pattern Searching, and Optimized Algorithm for Pattern Searching¹.

Pattern searching has many real-life applications such as searching for keywords in a document, searching for a specific string in a database, searching for a specific word in a book or article, and many more.

I hope this helps!

> What are KMP and Rabin-Karp algorithms?

The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm for Pattern Searching and the Rabin-Karp Algorithm for Pattern Searching are two algorithms that can be used to improve the speed of pattern searching.

The KMP algorithm is a linear time algorithm that uses a prefix function to avoid unnecessary comparisons. It preprocesses the pattern and creates a prefix table that is used to skip characters in the text that have already been matched. The worst-case time complexity of this algorithm is O(m+n) where m is the length of the pattern and n is the length of the text⁴.

The Rabin-Karp algorithm is another linear time algorithm that uses hashing to find an exact match of a pattern string in a text. It matches the hash value of the pattern with the hash value of the current substring of text, and if the hash values match then only it starts matching individual characters. The worst-case time complexity of this algorithm is O(m*(n-m+1)) where m is the length of the pattern and n is the length of the text³.

> Using a Word document, illustrate the Karp-Rabin algorithm on T= AABAACAADAABAAABAA and P= AABA. Be sure to show each step of the process in your illustration.

Here's how the Karp-Rabin algorithm works on T= AABAACAADAABAAABAA and P= AABA:

1. Calculate the hash value of the pattern P. Let's say it is hP.
2. Calculate the hash value of the first substring of T that is of the same length as P. Let's say it is hT.
3. Compare hP and hT. If they are equal, compare each character of P with the corresponding character of T. If they all match, then we have found a match.
4. If hP and hT are not equal, slide the window one position to the right and calculate the new hash value of the substring of T that is now under consideration. Let's say it is hT'.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until either a match is found or all substrings of T have been considered.

Here's how it works on our example:

1. The hash value of AABA is 1*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 2*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 8+4+4+0 = 16.
2. The hash value of AABA in T is 1*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 2*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 8+4+4+0 = 16.
3. Since hP and hT are equal, we compare each character of P with the corresponding character of T. They all match, so we have found a match.
4. We stop here since we have found a match.

> Can you write pseudocode for the Naive or Brute Force Algorithm for Pattern Searching?

```
NaivePatternSearch(T, P):
    n = length(T)
    m = length(P)
    for i = 0 to n-m:
        j = 0
        while j < m and T[i+j] = P[j]:
            j = j + 1
        if j = m:
            print "Pattern found at index ", i
```

> Here's the pseudocode for the Rabin-Karp Algorithm for Pattern Searching:

```
RabinKarp(T, P):
    n = length(T)
    m = length(P)
    hP = hash(P)
    for i = 0 to n-m:
        hT = hash(T[i:i+m])
        if hT = hP:
            if T[i:i+m] = P:
                print "Pattern found at index ", i
    return
```

Here, T is the text and P is the pattern we are searching for. The algorithm calculates the hash value of the pattern and then compares it with the hash value of each substring of T that is of the same length as P. If the hash values match, then we compare each character of P with the corresponding character of T. If they all match, then we have found a match.
