### Specification

Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element 
from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning of the array.

The algorithm works by dividing the input array into two parts: the sorted part 
and the unsorted part. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire array. 
In each iteration, the algorithm finds the smallest element in the unsorted part 
and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part, thereby expanding the sorted part by one element.

The time complexity of the selection sort algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. Selection sort is not very efficient for large arrays, but it is simple and easy to implement.

### Example 

> Could you provide an example of sorting an actual array with selection sort, performing the operations mentioned above step-by-step ? 

Sure, I can give you an example of sorting an array using the selection sort algorithm.

Let's say we have the following unsorted array of integers:

```csharp
[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
```

To sort this array using selection sort, we would follow these steps:

1. Set the first element (64) as the minimum element.

2. Compare the minimum element with the next element (25). Since 25 is less than 64, set it as the new minimum element.

3. Continue comparing the minimum element (25) with the remaining elements of the array. If a smaller element is found, set it as the new minimum element.

4. Once all the elements have been compared, swap the minimum element (11) with the first element of the unsorted part of the array (64).

5. Repeat the above steps for the remaining unsorted part of the array (excluding the first element).

Here are the step-by-step operations to sort the above array using selection sort:

```csharp
Step 1:
[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]  // original array
[11, 25, 12, 22, 64]  // minimum element (11) is swapped with first element (64)

Step 2:
[11, 25, 12, 22, 64]  // minimum element is 12
[11, 12, 25, 22, 64]  // minimum element (12) is swapped with second element (25)

Step 3:
[11, 12, 25, 22, 64]  // minimum element is still 22
[11, 12, 22, 25, 64]  // minimum element (22) is swapped with fourth element (25)

Step 4:
[11, 12, 22, 25, 64]  // minimum element is already the first element

Step 5:
[11, 12, 22, 25, 64]  // entire array is now sorted
```

As you can see, the selection sort algorithm first finds the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part. It then repeats this process for the remaining unsorted part of the array until the entire array is sorted in ascending order.

---
### Example: Separate Arrays 

> Here's an example of how the selection sort algorithm can be applied to two separate arrays, one for the sorted part and the other for the unsorted part:

```python
// unsorted array
unsorted_array = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]

// sorted array (initialized as empty)
sorted_array = []

// repeat until the unsorted array is empty
while len(unsorted_array) > 0:
    # find the minimum element in the unsorted array
    min_idx = 0
    for i in range(1, len(unsorted_array)):
        if unsorted_array[i] < unsorted_array[min_idx]:
            min_idx = i
    
    # remove the minimum element from the unsorted array and add it to the sorted array
    sorted_array.append(unsorted_array.pop(min_idx))

print(sorted_array)
```

In this implementation, we start with an unsorted array and an empty sorted array. 
We repeatedly find the minimum element in the unsorted array and remove it from the unsorted array, 
adding it to the sorted array. We repeat this process until the unsorted array is empty.

Here are the step-by-step operations to sort the above array using selection sort:

```less
Step 1:
unsorted_array = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]  // original unsorted array
sorted_array = []  // empty sorted array

min_idx = 4  // minimum element is 11
unsorted_array = [64, 25, 12, 22]  // 11 is removed from the unsorted array
sorted_array = [11]  // 11 is added to the sorted array

Step 2:
unsorted_array = [64, 25, 12, 22]  // remaining unsorted array
sorted_array = [11]  // sorted array

min_idx = 2  // minimum element is 12
unsorted_array = [64, 25, 22]  // 12 is removed from the unsorted array
sorted_array = [11, 12]  // 12 is added to the sorted array

Step 3:
unsorted_array = [64, 25, 22]  // remaining unsorted array
sorted_array = [11, 12]  // sorted array

min_idx = 2  // minimum element is 22
unsorted_array = [64, 25]  // 22 is removed from the unsorted array
sorted_array = [11, 12, 22]  // 22 is added to the sorted array

Step 4:
unsorted_array = [64, 25]  // remaining unsorted array
sorted_array = [11, 12, 22]  // sorted array

min_idx = 1  // minimum element is 25
unsorted_array = [64]  // 25 is removed from the unsorted array
sorted_array = [11, 12, 22, 25]  // 25 is added to the sorted array

Step 5:
unsorted_array = [64]  // remaining unsorted array
sorted_array = [11, 12, 22, 25]  // sorted array

min_idx = 0  // minimum element is 64
unsorted_array = []  // 64 is removed from the unsorted array
sorted_array = [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]  // 64 is added to the sorted array

Step 6:
unsorted_array = []  // remaining unsorted array is empty
sorted_array = [11, 12, 22,
```

### Example Code With Print Statements 

> Here's the same example code with print statements added to show the step-by-step operations:

```python
# unsorted array
unsorted_array = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]

# sorted array (initialized as empty)
sorted_array = []

# repeat until the unsorted array is empty
while len(unsorted_array) > 0:
    # find the minimum element in the unsorted array
    min_idx = 0
    for i in range(1, len(unsorted_array)):
        if unsorted_array[i] < unsorted_array[min_idx]:
            min_idx = i
    
    # remove the minimum element from the unsorted array and add it to the sorted array
    min_val = unsorted_array.pop(min_idx)
    sorted_array.append(min_val)
    
    # print the current state of the arrays
    print("unsorted array: ", unsorted_array)
    print("sorted array: ", sorted_array)
    print("-------------------")

# print the final sorted array
print("final sorted array: ", sorted_array)
```

And here's the corresponding output with the step-by-step operations:

```markdown
unsorted array:  [25, 12, 22, 11, 64]
sorted array:  [11]
-------------------
unsorted array:  [25, 12, 22, 64]
sorted array:  [11, 12]
-------------------
unsorted array:  [25, 22, 64]
sorted array:  [11, 12, 22]
-------------------
unsorted array:  [25, 64]
sorted array:  [11, 12, 22, 25]
-------------------
unsorted array:  [64]
sorted array:  [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
-------------------
final sorted array:  [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
```
Each iteration of the while loop finds the minimum element in the unsorted array, removes it, and adds it to the sorted array. The current state of the arrays is printed after each iteration to show the step-by-step operations of the selection sort algorithm.

### Advantages & Disadvantages 

> What are the advantages and disadvantages of selection sort ? 

Selection sort has some advantages and disadvantages as follows:

**Advantages:**

1. **Simplicity:** Selection sort is a simple algorithm to understand and implement, requiring only basic programming knowledge.

2. **In-place sorting:** Selection sort operates on the original input array and doesn't require any additional space, making it an in-place sorting algorithm.

3. **No recursion:** Selection sort is a non-recursive sorting algorithm, which means it doesn't require recursion to sort the input array.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Time complexity:** Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, which means it is inefficient for large arrays.

2. **Slow for nearly sorted arrays:** Selection sort's performance is not optimized for nearly sorted arrays because it still has to make n-1 comparisons even if the input array is already nearly sorted.

3. **Unstable:** Selection sort is an unstable sorting algorithm, meaning that the relative order of equal elements in the input array may not be preserved in the sorted array.

Overall, while selection sort is a simple and easy-to-implement algorithm, its time complexity and lack of optimization for nearly sorted arrays make it less efficient than other sorting algorithms for large input sizes.

---
### Comparisons 

> Please compare selection sort to other algorithms. 

Selection sort is one of the simpler sorting algorithms, but it has some limitations compared to other algorithms.

Here are some comparisons between selection sort and other popular sorting algorithms:

- **Insertion sort:** Both selection sort and insertion sort have time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case. However, insertion sort can perform better than selection sort on nearly sorted or small input arrays because it makes fewer comparisons and swaps.
- **Bubble sort:** Bubble sort is similar to selection sort in that they both have a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case. However, bubble sort makes more comparisons and swaps than selection sort, so it is generally less efficient.
- **Merge sort:** Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case, which is much better than selection sort for large input sizes. Merge sort is also a stable sorting algorithm, which means that the relative order of equal elements is preserved in the sorted array. However, merge sort requires additional space for merging subarrays, which makes it less space-efficient than selection sort.
- **Quick sort:** Quick sort has an average time complexity of O(n log n), which makes it faster than selection sort for large input sizes. However, its worst-case time complexity is O(n^2), which can occur if the pivot element is chosen poorly. Quick sort is also not a stable sorting algorithm, so it may not preserve the relative order of equal elements.

In summary, selection sort is a simple and easy-to-implement algorithm, but it has limitations in terms of time complexity and optimization for nearly sorted arrays. Other sorting algorithms such as insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort offer better time complexity and stability, but may be more complex to implement.

### Complexity Analysis

> Could you provide a full time and space complexity analysis for selection sort? 

- **Time Complexity:**
In selection sort, we repeatedly find the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and swap it with the element at the beginning of the unsorted part. The algorithm performs n-1 comparisons to find the minimum element in the first pass, n-2 comparisons to find the minimum element in the second pass, and so on. Therefore, the total number of comparisons is:

```
(n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 2 + 1 = n(n-1)/2
```

This gives us a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, as the algorithm needs to perform n^2/2 comparisons to sort the array.

- **Space Complexity:**
Selection sort operates on the original input array and doesn't require any additional space. Therefore, the space complexity of selection sort is O(1), which means it is an in-place sorting algorithm.

Overall, selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) and a space complexity of O(1). It is a simple algorithm to understand and implement, but it is not optimized for nearly sorted arrays and can be slow for large input sizes. However, it is a good algorithm to use for small or already mostly sorted arrays because it requires very little additional memory.
