> How are graphs represented in graph algorithms?

Graphs are data structures that represent the relationship between various objects. Graphs can be represented in different ways depending on the situation and the algorithm that we want to run on them. Here are some common ways to represent graphs:

- **Edge lists**: This is a list of edges, where each edge is an array of two vertex numbers or an object containing the vertex numbers and optionally the edge weight. The space required for an edge list is Θ(E), where E is the number of edges. To find whether a particular edge is in the graph, we have to search through the edge list, which can take O(E) time if the edges are unordered¹.
- **Adjacency matrices**: This is a matrix of size V×V, where V is the number of vertices, and each entry is 1 if there is an edge between the corresponding vertices, or 0 otherwise. If the edges have weights, we can put them in the matrix entries instead of 1s. The space required for an adjacency matrix is Θ(V^2). To find whether a particular edge is in the graph, we just need to look up the matrix entry in O(1) time¹.
- **Adjacency lists**: This is a list of lists, where each list corresponds to a vertex and contains its neighbors. If the edges have weights, we can store them along with the neighbors. The space required for an adjacency list is Θ(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E E is the number of edges. To find whether a particular edge is in the graph, we have to search through the list of one of its endpoints, which can take O(V) time in the worst case³.

You can see some examples of these representations in ¹ and ³. You can also learn more about graphs and their properties in ² and ⁴.

> What is Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm?

Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm is a popular algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.

The algorithm works by maintaining a set of visited nodes and a set of unvisited nodes. It starts at the source node and iteratively selects the unvisited node with the lowest distance from the source. It then visits the neighbors of this node and updates their distances if a shorter path is found. This process continues until the destination node is reached, or all reachable nodes have been visited².

The algorithm can be implemented using different data structures, such as arrays, priority queues, or heaps, to store and query the partial solutions sorted by distance from the source. The choice of data structure affects the time complexity of the algorithm. The original algorithm by Dijkstra does not use a min-priority queue and runs in O (V^2) O(V^2) time, where V V is the number of nodes. Using a Fibonacci heap min-priority queue can optimize the running time to O(E + V \\log V), where E is the number of edges³.

You can see some examples of how Dijkstra’s algorithm works in ¹ and ⁴. You can also learn more about the algorithm and its variants in ² and ⁵.

> What graph applications does Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm have?

Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm has many applications in graph problems where finding the shortest path between nodes is crucial. Some of these applications are:

- **Digital mapping services**: Dijkstra’s algorithm can be used to find the shortest route between two locations on a map, such as Google Maps. The nodes can represent cities or places, and the edges can represent roads or paths with weights corresponding to distances or travel times¹.
- **Social networking applications**: Dijkstra’s algorithm can be used to find the shortest path between two users in a social network, measured by the number of connections or handshakes between them. This can help suggest potential friends or contacts that a user may know¹.
- **Telephone network**: Dijkstra’s algorithm can be used to find the optimal route for a telephone call between two cities or places, minimizing the bandwidth or cost of the transmission. The nodes can represent switching stations, and the edges can represent transmission lines with weights corresponding to bandwidths¹.
- **IP routing**: Dijkstra’s algorithm can be used to find the open shortest path first (OSPF), which is a link-state routing protocol that determines the best path for data packets across a network of routers. The nodes can represent routers, and the edges can represent links with weights corresponding to metrics such as hop count, delay, or reliability².
