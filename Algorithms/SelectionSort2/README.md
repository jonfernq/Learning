## Selection Sort #2 

Selection sort is a simple comparison-based in place sorting algorithm.

The smallest (or largest) element is selected from the unsorted part of an array 
and moving it to the beginning (or end) of the sorted part of the array.

Pseudocode:

```css
for i from 0 to n-1
    min_idx = i
    for j from i+1 to n
        if A[j] < A[min_idx]
            min_idx = j
    swap A[i] with A[min_idx]
```

Where:

- A is the input array to be sorted
- n is the length of the array
- min_idx keeps track of the index of the minimum (or maximum) element in the unsorted part of the array
- swap is a function that swaps two elements in an array

### Advantages & Disadvantages

Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst, average, and best cases, 
so it is not efficient for large datasets. 

However, it has the advantage of being simple to implement and understand. 

Selection sort is an "in-place" sorting algorithm with the lowest possible space complexity of O(1). It operates directly on the input array and only swaps elements within the array to achieve sorted order, so it does not require allocation of additional memory as temporary storage during sorting. So, if memory usage needs to me minimized, this is a desirable feature. 

There are more efficient sorting algorithms such as merge sort, quicksort, and heapsort 
that are generally preferred for larger datasets.
