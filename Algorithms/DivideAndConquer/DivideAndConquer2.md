## Divide and Conquer 

> Explain the 'divide and conquer' approach.

'Divide and conquer' ia a problem-solving approach that divides a complex problem into easier sub-problems.
and then combines the solutions of these problems into a solution to the complex problem: 

- **Divide:** divide complex prroblem into easier smaller sub-problems. 

- **Conquer:** Solve sub-problems independently with same algorithm or approach, recursively or iteratively. 

- **Combine:** Combine solutions to sub-problems into solution to original complex problem. 

- **Base case:** A condition for terminating recursion or iteration, indicating when complex problem 
has been simplified enough to be solved without further division.

- **Merge Sort:** Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm that uses the divide and conquer approach to sort an array of elements. It divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts the two halves, and then merges the sorted halves to obtain the final sorted array.

- **Quick Sort:** Quick Sort is another sorting algorithm that uses the divide and conquer approach. It selects a pivot element from the array, partitions the array into two subarrays based on the pivot, and recursively sorts the two subarrays. The pivot selection and partitioning steps involve dividing the problem into smaller subproblems that are solved independently.

- **Binary Search:** Binary Search is a search algorithm that uses the divide and conquer approach to find the position of a target element in a sorted array. It repeatedly divides the array into smaller halves until the target element is found or the search space is exhausted.

- **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):** The FFT algorithm is a widely used algorithm in signal processing and other fields that uses the divide and conquer approach to efficiently compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a sequence of values. It recursively divides the sequence into smaller subproblems and combines the solutions to obtain the DFT.
