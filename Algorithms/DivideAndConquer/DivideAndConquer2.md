## Divide and Conquer 

'Divide and conquer' ia a problem-solving approach that divides a complex problem into easier sub-problems.
and then combines the solutions of these problems into a solution to the complex problem: 

- **Divide:** divide complex prroblem into easier smaller sub-problems. 

- **Conquer:** Solve sub-problems independently with same algorithm or approach, recursively or iteratively. 

- **Combine:** Combine solutions to sub-problems into solution to original complex problem. 

- **Base case:** A condition for terminating recursion or iteration, indicating when complex problem 
- has been simplified enough to be solved without further division.
