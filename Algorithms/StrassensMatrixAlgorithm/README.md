## Strassen's Matrix Multiplication Algorithm 

> Do you know about Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication ? 

Strassen's algorithm is a fast method for multiplying two matrices that reduces the number of required multiplications 
compared to the traditional matrix multiplication algorithm, known as the naive algorithm or the standard algorithm. 
It was developed by Volker Strassen in 1969 and is based on the principle of divide-and-conquer.

The key idea behind Strassen's algorithm is to divide each of the two input matrices into four smaller matrices, 
and recursively compute products of these smaller matrices using a set of seven multiplications and additional additions/subtractions. 
This allows for reducing the number of multiplications required for matrix multiplication from 8 in the naive algorithm to 7 in Strassen's algorithm, 
resulting in a faster overall computation time for large matrices.

Strassen's algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^log2(7)), which is approximately O(n^2.81), 
making it faster than the naive algorithm for large matrix sizes. However, due to its recursive nature 
and additional additions/subtractions, Strassen's algorithm may not always be the most efficient algorithm 
for small matrix sizes or for certain hardware architectures with efficient matrix multiplication operations. 
Other more sophisticated algorithms, such as the Coppersmith-Winograd algorithm, have been developed 
to further optimize matrix multiplication for certain matrix sizes and hardware configurations.

for matrix multiplication from 8 in the naive algorithm to 7 in Strassen's algorithm"

Let's consider the multiplication of two 2x2 matrices, A and B, using both the naive algorithm and Strassen's algorithm.

Naive - **Algorithm:**

```markdown
A = | a11  a12 |    B = | b11  b12 |
    |         |        |         |
    | a21  a22 |        | b21  b22 |

C = | c11  c12 | = | a11*b11 + a12*b21  a11*b12 + a12*b22 |
    |         |     |                                            |
    | c21  c22 |     | a21*b11 + a22*b21  a21*b12 + a22*b22 |
In the naive algorithm, we need to perform 8 multiplications to compute the four elements of the resulting matrix C.

Strassen's - **Algorithm:**

```scss
A = | a11  a12 |    B = | b11  b12 |
    |         |        |         |
    | a21  a22 |        | b21  b22 |

P1 = a11 * (b12 - b22)
P2 = (a11 + a12) * b22
P3 = (a21 + a22) * b11
P4 = a22 * (b21 - b11)
P5 = (a11 + a22) * (b11 + b22)
P6 = (a12 - a22) * (b21 + b22)
P7 = (a11 - a21) * (b11 + b12)

C = | c11  c12 | = | P5 + P4 - P2 + P6  P1 + P2 |
    |         |     |                                         |
    | c21  c22 |     | P3 + P4  P5 + P1 - P3 - P7 |
```

In Strassen's algorithm, we can see that we only need to perform 7 multiplications (P1 to P7) to compute the four elements of the resulting matrix C, instead of 8 as in the naive algorithm.

So, Strassen's algorithm reduces the number of multiplications required for matrix multiplication from 8 in the naive algorithm to 7, resulting in potentially faster matrix multiplication for large matrices. However, it's worth noting that Strassen's algorithm involves additional additions and subtractions compared to the naive algorithm, which may impact the overall computational efficiency depending on the specific hardware and matrix sizes.

> Can you write some simple pseudocode for the naive and Strassen's algorithm ? 

Sure! Here's a simple pseudocode for both the naive algorithm and Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication.

Naive - **Algorithm:**

```less
function multiply_matrices_naive(A, B):
    # - **Input:** A, B are n x n matrices
    # - **Output:** C, the product of A and B, an n x n matrix
    n = size(A)
    C = initialize n x n matrix with zeros
    
    for i = 1 to n - **do:**
        for j = 1 to n - **do:**
            for k = 1 to n - **do:**
                C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]
                
    return C
```

Strassen's - **Algorithm:**

```bash
function multiply_matrices_strassen(A, B):
    # - **Input:** A, B are n x n matrices
    # - **Output:** C, the product of A and B, an n x n matrix
    n = size(A)
    
    # Base - **case:** If matrices are 1 x 1, perform standard multiplication
    if n == - **1:**
        C = initialize 1 x 1 matrix
        C[1][1] = A[1][1] * B[1][1]
        return C
    
    # Split matrices A and B into four equally sized submatrices
    A11, A12, A21, A22 = split_into_submatrices(A)
    B11, B12, B21, B22 = split_into_submatrices(B)
    
    # Recursively compute seven products (P1 to P7)
    P1 = multiply_matrices_strassen(A11, B12 - B22)
    P2 = multiply_matrices_strassen(A11 + A12, B22)
    P3 = multiply_matrices_strassen(A21 + A22, B11)
    P4 = multiply_matrices_strassen(A22, B21 - B11)
    P5 = multiply_matrices_strassen(A11 + A22, B11 + B22)
    P6 = multiply_matrices_strassen(A12 - A22, B21 + B22)
    P7 = multiply_matrices_strassen(A11 - A21, B11 + B12)
    
    # Compute four quadrants of the resulting matrix C
    C11 = P5 + P4 - P2 + P6
    C12 = P1 + P2
    C21 = P3 + P4
    C22 = P5 + P1 - P3 - P7
    
    # Concatenate the four quadrants to form the resulting matrix C
    C = concatenate_quadrants(C11, C12, C21, C22)
    
    return C
```

Note that the pseudocode provided above is a simplified version and may need to be adapted or optimized 
for specific programming languages or platforms. Also, the functions split_into_submatrices, concatenate_quadrants, 
and size are utility functions that would need to be implemented separately to handle the splitting and concatenation of matrices, 
as well as determining the size of matrices, based on the conventions and syntax of the programming language you are using.
