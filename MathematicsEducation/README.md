The specific requirements for teacher certification in high school mathematics can vary by country and state or province within a country. However, here are some common undergraduate mathematics courses that are often required or recommended for individuals pursuing certification to teach high school mathematics:

1. Calculus: Typically, multiple courses in calculus, such as Calculus I, Calculus II, and Calculus III, are required. These courses cover topics such as limits, derivatives, integrals, sequences, series, and multivariable calculus.
    
2. Linear Algebra: A course in linear algebra introduces topics like vector spaces, matrices, systems of linear equations, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.
    
3. Differential Equations: This course focuses on solving and analyzing ordinary differential equations, including first-order equations, second-order linear equations, and systems of equations.
    
4. Probability and Statistics: A course in probability and statistics covers concepts such as probability theory, random variables, probability distributions, statistical inference, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis.
    
5. Discrete Mathematics: Discrete mathematics provides a foundation for topics like logic, sets, functions, combinatorics, graph theory, and discrete probability.
    
6. Number Theory: A course in number theory explores properties of integers, prime numbers, divisibility, congruences, and applications of number theory.
    
7. Geometry: Some programs may require a course in geometry, covering topics like Euclidean geometry, transformations, proofs, and properties of geometric figures.
