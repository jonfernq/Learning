> Do you know how I can set up a notification that Is very noticeable, that I cannot miss? 

If you want to set up a notification that is very noticeable and hard to miss, there are a few options you can consider depending on the platform you're using:

1. Sound: Choose a distinct and attention-grabbing sound for your notifications. Most messaging applications allow you to customize notification sounds. Pick something that stands out and catches your attention.
    
2. Vibration: Enable a strong and prolonged vibration pattern for your notifications. This can be especially useful when you're in a situation where sound is not appropriate or when your device is on silent mode.
    
3. LED Flash: If your device has an LED notification light, you can configure it to flash brightly and rapidly when a notification arrives. This visual cue can be highly noticeable, especially if you keep your device in your line of sight.
    
4. Banner or Pop-up Notifications: Many messaging apps provide options for banner or pop-up notifications that appear on your screen when a message is received. These notifications typically overlay on top of other content and can be hard to miss.
    
5. Importance Level: Some operating systems and messaging apps allow you to set the importance level of notifications. By designating a high importance level, the system will prioritize and display the notifications more prominently.
    
6. Persistent Reminder: If you need a notification that you absolutely cannot miss, consider setting up a persistent reminder. This could involve using a separate alarm or reminder app that provides persistent notifications until acknowledged or dismissed.
    

Remember to check the settings of your specific messaging app or device to see what customization options are available for notifications.

> Must I set up notifications for Line within Line, or can I use general Android notifications ? 

You can set up notifications for Line within the Line application itself, as well as using general Android notifications settings. Line has its own notification settings that allow you to customize how you receive and are alerted to new messages. Within the Line app, you can typically access notification settings by going to the app's settings menu or by tapping on your profile picture or avatar and selecting "Settings" or "Notifications."

In Line's notification settings, you can often configure options such as sound, vibration, LED light, and whether to display pop-up notifications or not. You can customize these settings to make Line notifications more noticeable and harder to miss.

Additionally, you can also utilize the general Android notification settings to further enhance Line notifications. Android allows you to manage notifications for each installed app individually through the system settings. By going to your device's "Settings," then "Apps & notifications," and finding Line in the list of installed apps, you can access additional notification settings. Here, you can configure aspects such as notification importance level, sound, vibration, and other options that can make Line notifications more prominent.

By combining the notification settings within the Line app and the general Android notification settings, you can create a highly noticeable notification experience for Line messages.
