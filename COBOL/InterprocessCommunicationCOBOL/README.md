## Interprocess Communication with GNUCobol

ChatGPT: 
- There are several options for interprocess communication (IPC) that you can use with GNUCOBOL programs, and you can compile and link them using GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for integration with your COBOL program. Here are some common options: 
1. POSIX Message Queues: POSIX message queues provide a mechanism for processes to send and receive messages, similar to pipes or sockets. You can use the `mq_open`, `mq_send`, and `mq_receive` functions from the POSIX message queue API in your C code, and then compile and link it with GCC to use in your GNUCOBOL program. 
2. Shared Memory: Shared memory allows processes to share a region of memory, which can be used for communication and data sharing. You can use the `shmget`, `shmat`, and `shmdt` functions from the System V shared memory API in your C code, and then compile and link it with GCC for use in your GNUCOBOL program. 
3. Unix Domain Sockets: Unix domain sockets provide a communication mechanism between processes on the same machine, similar to network sockets. You can use the `socket`, `bind`, `listen`, `accept`, `connect`, `send`, and `recv` functions from the Unix domain socket API in your C code, and then compile and link it with GCC for integration with your GNUCOBOL program. 
4. Pipes: Pipes allow communication between two related processes, where the output of one process is connected to the input of another process. You can use the `pipe`, `fork`, and `exec` functions in your C code to create pipes, fork processes, and execute other processes, and then compile and link it with GCC for use in your GNUCOBOL program. 
5. External Programs: You can also invoke external programs from your GNUCOBOL program using the `CALL` statement or the `SYSTEM` environment variable, and pass data between them using command-line arguments, standard input/output, or temporary files.

When compiling and linking C code with GCC for integration with GNUCOBOL, you may need to specify appropriate linker options and include relevant header files in your C code. It's recommended to refer to the GCC documentation and the documentation of the specific IPC mechanism you choose for more detailed information on how to compile, link, and use them in your GNUCOBOL program.
