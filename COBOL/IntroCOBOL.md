## Intro to COBOL

> It seems that what COBOL does is write reports and also CRUD like functionality with databases? 

COBOL, which stands for COmmon Business-Oriented Language, is a programming language that was originally designed for business applications and has been used extensively in the field of enterprise computing. While COBOL is often associated with applications that involve report generation and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with databases, it is capable of more than just these functionalities.

COBOL is a procedural language that provides features for performing calculations, manipulating data, and controlling program flow. It supports file handling operations, such as reading from and writing to files, which makes it suitable for handling data in batch processing environments. COBOL also provides support for working with databases, including interfacing with relational databases through embedded SQL or using COBOL's built-in database management system called COBOL Database Connectivity (CODBC).

In addition to report generation and database operations, COBOL can be used to implement business logic, perform data validation, and implement complex business rules. COBOL programs can be used to process large volumes of data, perform data transformations, and implement complex data processing workflows.

While COBOL may have a specific niche in the realm of business applications and batch processing, it has a long history of successful use in mission-critical systems and continues to be used in many legacy systems in various industries such as finance, insurance, healthcare, and government. It is known for its readability, reliability, and stability, which makes it well-suited for applications that require high levels of accuracy and stability, especially in large-scale, data-intensive environments.

> What user interface does gnucobol use , ncurses? 

GNU Cobol (GnuCOBOL) is a COBOL compiler that provides support for various user interfaces, including the ncurses library, which is a popular library for creating terminal-based user interfaces in Unix-like systems.

With ncurses, GnuCOBOL programs can create text-based interfaces with features such as menus, dialogs, forms, and windows, allowing for interactive user interactions in a terminal or console environment. ncurses provides functions for handling terminal I/O, managing screen layout, handling keyboard input, and displaying text and graphical elements in a terminal window.

In addition to ncurses, GnuCOBOL also supports other UI libraries and frameworks, depending on the platform and configuration, such as Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL), GTK (GIMP Toolkit), and Windows API (for compiling GnuCOBOL programs on Windows using Cygwin or other Windows-compatible environments).

The choice of user interface library depends on the specific requirements of the application and the platform on which the GnuCOBOL program is being compiled and executed.
