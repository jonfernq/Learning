# Math in Markdown

> If mathematical expressions must be included in Markdown, how can this be accomplished ? 

Markdown, by default, does not support rendering mathematical expressions or equations. 
However, there are several ways to include mathematical expressions in Markdown 
documents by using additional tools or libraries that provide support for rendering mathematical notation. 
Here are a few common methods:

- LaTeX/MathJax: LaTeX is a popular typesetting system commonly used for writing scientific and mathematical documents. MathJax is a JavaScript library that can render LaTeX code in HTML documents. You can include LaTeX expressions directly in your Markdown document using special delimiters, such as $$ for display mode equations or $ for inline equations, and then use MathJax to render them when displaying the Markdown document in a web browser.

Example:

```markdown
This is an inline equation: $E=mc^2$

This is a display mode equation:
$$
E=mc^2
$$
```

- KaTeX: KaTeX is a fast and lightweight JavaScript library for rendering mathematical expressions in web pages. Similar to MathJax, you can include KaTeX expressions in your Markdown document using special delimiters, and then use KaTeX to render them when displaying the Markdown document in a web browser.

Example:

```markdown
This is an inline equation: \(E=mc^2\)

This is a display mode equation:
\[
E=mc^2
\]
```

- Online equation editors: There are several online equation editors that allow you to create and generate mathematical expressions as images or other formats, which can then be included in your Markdown document. Some popular online equation editors include CodeCogs, MathType, and LaTeXiT.

Example:

```markdown
![Equation](https://www.example.com/equation.png)
```

Note that the specific method for including mathematical expressions in Markdown may depend on the platform or environment you are using, as different Markdown parsers or editors may have different syntax or support for rendering mathematical notation. It's recommended to consult the documentation or help resources of your specific Markdown tool or environment for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
