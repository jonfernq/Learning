> It seems that Wikipedia uses a sort of Markdown, but contemporary markdown seems to have gone beyond this. Which markdown standard can duplicate and go beyond what Wikipedia, or rather Wikimedia provides? 

Wikipedia uses a markup language called Wikitext, which is specific to the platform and not directly compatible with modern Markdown syntax. While there is no single Markdown standard that perfectly duplicates all of the features of Wikitext, there are several Markdown flavors and extensions that can provide similar or expanded functionality.

One of the most popular Markdown flavors that extends beyond the basic syntax is called GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM), which is used by the popular code-sharing platform GitHub. GFM includes many extensions, such as support for task lists, tables, and strikethrough formatting. GFM also supports syntax highlighting for code blocks and allows for nested inline formatting.

Another popular Markdown flavor that includes extended functionality is called CommonMark. CommonMark is a standardized version of Markdown that aims to create a consistent syntax across different platforms and implementations. CommonMark includes many features beyond basic Markdown, such as tables, definition lists, and strikethrough formatting.

Additionally, there are many Markdown extensions available that can add even more functionality to the language, such as footnotes, citations, and image resizing. These extensions can be used with different Markdown flavors to provide a custom syntax tailored to the needs of a particular project.

Overall, while no single Markdown standard can perfectly replicate all of the features of Wikitext, there are many Markdown flavors and extensions available that can provide similar or expanded functionality.


> Footnotes, and citations are absolutely essential to Wikipedia pages along with other formatting, which advanced markdown standard can provide this ? 

There are several Markdown standards and extensions that support footnotes, citations, and other advanced formatting features that are essential to Wikipedia pages. Some of these include:

Pandoc Markdown: Pandoc is a popular document converter that supports multiple input and output formats, including Markdown. Pandoc Markdown includes many extensions beyond basic Markdown, such as footnotes, citations, tables, and definition lists.

CommonMark with extensions: CommonMark is a standardized version of Markdown that includes many features beyond basic Markdown, such as tables, definition lists, and strikethrough formatting. CommonMark also allows for extensions to be added to the syntax to support additional functionality, such as footnotes and citations.

MultiMarkdown: MultiMarkdown is an extension of Markdown that includes many advanced formatting features, including footnotes, citations, tables, and metadata. MultiMarkdown is designed to be highly customizable and supports a wide range of output formats, including HTML, LaTeX, and PDF.

GitHub Flavored Markdown with extensions: GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) is a popular Markdown flavor that includes many extensions, such as support for task lists, tables, and strikethrough formatting. GFM also allows for extensions to be added to the syntax to support additional functionality, such as footnotes and citations.

These Markdown standards and extensions can be used to create richly formatted content, including footnotes and citations, that is similar in style and functionality to Wikipedia pages.

> how does one  add GFM extensions ? 
GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) includes many extensions that are not part of standard Markdown. To use GFM extensions, you can simply use the appropriate syntax in your Markdown documents. Here are some examples of how to use some of the most commonly used GFM extensions:

Task lists: To create a task list, use the following syntax:

scss
Copy code
- [ ] Task 1
- [x] Task 2 (completed)
This will create a list with checkboxes next to each item, with "Task 1" unchecked and "Task 2" checked.

Tables: To create a table, use the following syntax:

sql
Copy code
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Row 1, Column 1 | Row 1, Column 2 |
| Row 2, Column 1 | Row 2, Column 2 |
This will create a table with two columns and two rows.

Strikethrough: To create strikethrough text, use the following syntax:

vbnet
Copy code
~~This text is strikethrough.~~
This will create text with a line through the middle.

There are many other GFM extensions available, including syntax highlighting, task lists, and autolinking. To use these extensions, simply consult the GFM documentation to learn the appropriate syntax.


> Which in the above list is most popular and has greatest functionality, MultiMarkdown ?

Each of the Markdown standards and extensions I mentioned have their own strengths and popularity, and the choice of which one to use depends on your specific needs and preferences.

MultiMarkdown is a popular extension of Markdown that adds many advanced formatting features, including footnotes, citations, tables, and metadata. It also includes features specifically designed for academic writing, such as support for bibliographies and indexes. MultiMarkdown is highly customizable and supports a wide range of output formats, including HTML, LaTeX, and PDF.

However, CommonMark with extensions and Pandoc Markdown are also popular and widely used, and both support many advanced formatting features and extensions beyond basic Markdown.

Ultimately, the choice of which Markdown standard or extension to use depends on your specific needs and preferences, as well as the requirements of your project. It's a good idea to review the documentation and features of each standard or extension and choose the one that best suits your needs.


> Was R markdown the first to gain popularity in the recent growing trend of markdown languages ? 

R Markdown was not the first Markdown language, but it was one of the early adopters of Markdown for generating reports and documents in the R programming language.

Markdown was actually first created by John Gruber in 2004 as a lightweight markup language for formatting text using a plain-text syntax. Markdown quickly gained popularity among web developers and writers, and many other Markdown flavors and extensions were subsequently developed to support additional features and use cases.

R Markdown was first introduced in 2012 as a way to integrate Markdown with R, allowing users to generate reports and documents that combine code and text in a single document. R Markdown has become a popular tool for reproducible research, as it allows users to easily document and share their data analysis workflows.

Since the introduction of R Markdown, many other Markdown flavors and extensions have emerged to support different programming languages and use cases, including Jupyter Notebook Markdown for Python, Julia, and R; GitHub Flavored Markdown for documentation and code sharing on GitHub; and MultiMarkdown for academic writing and publishing.
