## Comparing Markdowns: reStructuredText vs. others 

> What is the main system for Python documentation? 

The main system for Python documentation is the Python documentation website, which is available at https://docs.python.org/. This website contains the official documentation for the Python programming language, including the Python standard library, tutorials, and guides for using Python, and other useful resources for Python developers.

The documentation is available in multiple formats, including HTML, PDF, and plain text, and is organized into sections that cover different topics related to Python programming. The website also includes a search function that allows you to quickly find information on specific topics, as well as a community forum where you can ask questions and get help from other Python users.

> Is it possible to volunteer as an open source contributor there ? 

Yes, it is possible to volunteer as an open source contributor to the Python documentation. The Python documentation is maintained by a community of volunteers who contribute their time and expertise to improve the quality and accuracy of the documentation.

To get started, you can visit the Python documentation website at https://docs.python.org/ and navigate to the "Contributing to Documentation" section. This section provides information on how to contribute to the documentation, including guidelines for writing and editing documentation, and how to submit contributions for review.

You can also join the Python documentation community on GitHub, where you can find open issues and pull requests related to the documentation, as well as contribute your own changes and improvements. Additionally, you can participate in the Python documentation mailing list or IRC channel to get more involved in the community and connect with other contributors.

> I heard that the software that powers Python documentation is called Sphinx? 

Yes, that's correct! The software that powers the Python documentation is called Sphinx. Sphinx is a documentation generator that is designed specifically for Python, but it can be used with other programming languages as well.

Sphinx uses reStructuredText as its markup language, which is a lightweight markup language that is easy to read and write. The reStructuredText files are then processed by Sphinx to generate HTML, PDF, and other output formats.

Sphinx provides a range of features that make it a popular choice for documenting Python projects. For example, it supports automatic generation of API documentation from Python code, cross-referencing between different parts of the documentation, and the ability to include code samples and other interactive elements in the documentation.

In addition to being used for the Python documentation, Sphinx is also used by many other open source projects to generate their documentation, including Django, SQLAlchemy, and many more.

> What special features does  reStructuredText have, beyond those of GitHub Flavored Markdown? How does it compare to the markdown that the Jekyll static site generator uses, which I believe is called CommonMark?  

reStructuredText and Markdown are both lightweight markup languages that are designed to be easy to read and write, and both are commonly used for writing documentation and other types of content. While they share some similarities, there are also some key differences between the two.

Here are some features of reStructuredText that go beyond the capabilities of GitHub Flavored Markdown:

**Cross-referencing:** reStructuredText allows you to easily create cross-references between different parts of your documentation using a simple syntax.

**Table of contents:** reStructuredText can automatically generate a table of contents based on the headings in your document.

**Inline markup:** reStructuredText provides a rich set of inline markup options, including support for bold, italic, underline, and many other styles.

**Directives:** reStructuredText allows you to define custom directives that can be used to create custom elements in your documentation.

Support for complex layouts: reStructuredText provides a number of features that make it easier to create complex layouts, such as nested lists, tables, and images with captions.

In comparison to Markdown, reStructuredText is generally more powerful and flexible, but also has a steeper learning curve. While Markdown is easier to learn and use, it may not be sufficient for more complex documentation needs.

As for Jekyll's use of Markdown, Jekyll uses a variant of Markdown called Kramdown, which supports many of the same features as CommonMark. Kramdown also supports some additional features, such as support for definition lists and tables with row and column spans. However, it doesn't provide all the same features as reStructuredText, such as cross-referencing and directives.

> Does reStructuredText, support the features one needs for academic writing such as citations, footnotes and references? Or rendering math, or at least generation of LaTeX dor publishing academic papers and books? 

Yes, reStructuredText does support many features that are useful for academic writing, such as citations, footnotes, and references. It also supports the inclusion of math expressions using LaTeX syntax.

Here are some examples of how reStructuredText can be used for academic writing:

**Citations:** reStructuredText provides a syntax for creating citations using a simple label system. You can create a citation reference using a label, and then include the full citation information in a separate "footnote" section.

**Footnotes:** reStructuredText supports footnotes using a simple syntax, allowing you to add additional information or commentary to your text without interrupting the flow.

**References:** reStructuredText also supports the creation of references, which allow you to easily link to other parts of your document or external resources.

**Math expressions:** reStructuredText provides support for math expressions using LaTeX syntax, allowing you to include complex mathematical equations and formulas in your text.

In addition to these features, reStructuredText can also be used to generate LaTeX output, which can be useful for academic writing and publishing. You can use reStructuredText to write your document, and then use Sphinx or another tool to generate LaTeX output that can be compiled into a PDF or other publication format.

> How does reStructuredText compare with R Markdown, widely used by data scientists using the R language? 

reStructuredText and R Markdown are both lightweight markup languages that are commonly used for writing documentation and other types of content. While they share some similarities, there are also some key differences between the two.

Here are some differences between reStructuredText and R Markdown:

**Syntax:** reStructuredText uses a syntax that is more similar to traditional markup languages, such as HTML and LaTeX, while R Markdown uses a syntax that is closer to plain text.

**Extensibility:** reStructuredText provides a more extensible architecture, allowing you to create custom directives and roles, while R Markdown is more limited in its extensibility.

**Customization:** reStructuredText provides a wider range of configuration options, allowing you to customize the output format to a greater extent, while R Markdown is more focused on providing a simple and easy-to-use default output format.

Support for different output formats: reStructuredText can be used to generate a wide range of output formats, including HTML, LaTeX, PDF, and more, while R Markdown is primarily focused on generating HTML and PDF output.

Integration with specific programming languages: R Markdown is tightly integrated with the R programming language, providing features such as inline code evaluation and automatic generation of plots, while reStructuredText is more focused on providing a general-purpose markup language that can be used with any programming language.

Overall, both reStructuredText and R Markdown are powerful and flexible tools for writing documentation and other types of content. Which one you choose will depend on your specific needs and preferences, as well as the tools and workflows you are already using.
