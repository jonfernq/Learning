## Python Shells

### Inquirer vs. Python Shells

> How does the Python Inquirer package for a command line interface, compare to custom python shells provided by ipython, bpython, and ptpython? 

The Python Inquirer package and custom Python shells like IPython, bpython, and ptpython serve different purposes and have different features.

The Python Inquirer package is a library that provides a collection of common interactive command line user interfaces (UIs) for Python scripts. These UIs include prompts for input, select menus, checkboxes, and more. The package aims to make it easy for developers to create interactive command line applications with a user-friendly interface.

On the other hand, custom Python shells like IPython, bpython, and ptpython are alternative REPLs (Read-Evaluate-Print Loops) that enhance the standard Python shell with additional features such as syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and history navigation. These shells are primarily used for interactive exploration, debugging, and experimentation with Python code.

While both Python Inquirer and custom Python shells provide interactive interfaces, they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts. Python Inquirer is best suited for creating command-line applications that require user interaction, while custom Python shells are more suited for interactive Python coding and experimentation.

In summary, Python Inquirer is a library for creating interactive command line applications with a user-friendly interface, while custom Python shells like IPython, bpython, and ptpython are REPLs that enhance the standard Python shell with additional features for interactive Python coding and experimentation.
