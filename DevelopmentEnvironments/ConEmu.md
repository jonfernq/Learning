Yes, ConEmu is a terminal emulator for Windows that supports multiple tabbed terminals. Here's how to create new tabs:

Open ConEmu by double-clicking the executable or launching it from the Start menu.

Once ConEmu is open, press Ctrl+T to create a new tab. You can also click the "+" button in the upper-right corner of the window.

To switch between tabs, you can use the Ctrl+Tab or Ctrl+Shift+Tab keyboard shortcuts. You can also click on the tabs at the top of the window to switch between them.

To close a tab, click the "X" button on the tab or press Ctrl+W.

If you need to split a tab into multiple panes, you can do so by right-clicking on the tab and selecting "Split to right" or "Split to bottom". This will create a new pane alongside the current one, allowing you to view multiple terminals at once.

Note that ConEmu also supports a wide range of customization options, including customizable keyboard shortcuts, color schemes, and font settings. You can access these settings by clicking on the "Settings" button in the toolbar or by pressing Win+Alt+P.
