## Ontologies

### Definition

> How would you define 'ontology' in the modern computer science sense of the term ? 

In modern computer science, an ontology is a formal and explicit specification of a conceptualization of a domain. It is a representation of the knowledge and information about a particular domain in a structured and organized way, using a set of concepts, relations, and axioms.

An ontology can be thought of as a "vocabulary" or "dictionary" that defines the terms and relationships used to describe a domain. It provides a shared understanding of the domain and facilitates communication and knowledge sharing among different systems and applications.

Ontologies are used in a variety of applications, including knowledge management, data integration, semantic search, and natural language processing. They can be represented in different formats such as RDF, OWL, or UML, and can be used with different tools and frameworks such as Protégé, Apache Jena, or Python's RDFLib.

Overall, ontologies play an important role in modern computer science by providing a way to represent and share knowledge about a domain in a standardized and interoperable manner.

Here are another useful definitions from Wikipedia: 

"In computer science and information science, an ontology encompasses a representation, formal naming, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse. More simply, an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related, by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject.

"Every academic discipline or field creates ontologies to limit complexity and organize data into information and knowledge. Each uses ontological assumptions to frame explicit theories, research and applications. New ontologies may improve problem solving within that domain. Translating research papers within every field is a problem made easier when experts from different countries maintain a controlled vocabulary of jargon between each of their languages." (Source: [Wikipedia on Ontology (Computer Science)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(computer_science)) )

And another: 

"Ontologies are a formal way to describe taxonomies and classification networks, essentially defining the structure of knowledge for various domains: the nouns representing classes of objects and the verbs representing relations between the objects."

"Ontologies resemble class hierarchies in object-oriented programming but there are several critical differences. Class hierarchies are meant to represent structures used in source code that evolve fairly slowly (perhaps with monthly revisions) whereas ontologies are meant to represent information on the Internet and are expected to be evolving almost constantly. Similarly, ontologies are typically far more flexible as they are meant to represent information on the Internet coming from all sorts of heterogeneous data sources. Class hierarchies on the other hand tend to be fairly static and rely on far less diverse and more structured sources of data such as corporate databases" (Source: [Wikipedia on Web Ontology Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language))

### Relations

> What are the different relations in a ontology? I am aware of the 'has a' and 'is a' relations. The 'is a' relation seems to be a taxonomy or taxonomic relation, as found in linnaean biological taxonomies to classify living things, for instance. What are the other relations of an ontology ? 

In ontology, there are several types of relations between concepts. Here are some of the most common ones:

"is a" (also known as "subclass-of" or "subsumption"): This is the most basic and important relation in ontology. It is used to represent a hierarchical or taxonomic relation between classes or concepts, where a subclass is a more specific type of its superclass. For example, "dog" is a subclass of "animal".

"part of" (also known as "has a" or "composition"): This relation is used to represent a part-whole relationship between two concepts, where one concept is a part of the other. For example, "wheel" is a part of "car".

"instance of" (also known as "type-of" or "instantiation"): This relation is used to represent a relationship between an individual and a class. It states that an individual is an instance of a class. For example, "Fido" is an instance of the class "dog".

"same as" (also known as "equivalence" or "identity"): This relation is used to represent that two concepts are identical or refer to the same thing. For example, "Washington D.C." is the same as "the capital of the United States".

"different from" (also known as "inequivalence" or "distinctness"): This relation is used to represent that two concepts are not identical or refer to different things. For example, "apple" is different from "orange".

"participates in" (also known as "participation" or "role"): This relation is used to represent the participation of an individual or a concept in an activity or a role. For example, "doctor" participates in the activity of "treating patients".

"causes" (also known as "causation" or "effect"): This relation is used to represent the causal relationship between two concepts, where one concept causes or influences the other. For example, "smoking" causes "lung cancer".

"located in" (also known as "location" or "place"): This relation is used to represent the location of an object or a concept. For example, "New York City" is located in "the United States".

These are just some of the most common relations in ontology. There are many other types of relations that can be used depending on the specific domain and application of the ontology.

### Python's Owlready Package 

> So how does the Python package Owlready compare with other ontology software? What are its plus points ? 

Owlready is a Python package for working with OWL ontologies, and it has several advantages over other ontology software:

**Integration with Python:** Owlready is designed to integrate well with Python, allowing users to access the full power of Python libraries and tools for working with ontologies.

**Simple and intuitive API:** Owlready provides a simple and intuitive API that makes it easy to create, modify, and query OWL ontologies using Python code.

Support for multiple formats: Owlready supports multiple formats for loading and saving ontologies, including OWL, RDF/XML, and N-Triples.

**Fast and efficient:** Owlready is optimized for performance, allowing users to work with large ontologies quickly and efficiently.

**Active development:** Owlready is actively developed and maintained, with regular updates and bug fixes.

**Free and open-source:** Owlready is released under the LGPL license, which means that it is free to use, modify, and distribute.

Overall, Owlready is a powerful and flexible tool for working with OWL ontologies, and its integration with Python makes it an attractive option for developers and researchers who want to work with ontologies in a familiar programming environment.
