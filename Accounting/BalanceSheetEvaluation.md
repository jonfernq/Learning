## Balance Sheet Comparison 

### 1. Discuss two ways in which the balance sheets differ across the two companies.
  
VF Corporation is an apparel and footwear manufacturing company that owns well-known brands such as The North Face, Vans, Timberland, Wrangler, and Lee. Here are financial ratios that allow balance sheet comparison between companies: 

                                                           2022        2021       2020       2018       2017

Johnson & Johnson is a healthcare company that develops and manufactures pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer healthcare products, with notable brands including Band-Aid, Tylenol, Neutrogena, and Johnson's Baby. Here are financial ratios that allow balance sheet comparison between companies:

                                                           2022        2021       2020       2018       2017

Comparing the financial ratios for the two companies, one can see that the receivables turnover ratio is always substantially higher for the garment manufacturer VF Corporation than it is for the pharmaceutical firm Johnson & Johnson. 

Though the inventory turnover ratio for 2022 is roughly the same for the two companies, before this, the inventory ratio was  substantially higher for the garment manufacturer than it is for the pharmaceutical company. 

Does this meet expectations according to industry norms? We now address this question.

### 1. Inventory

**Inventory Composition:** 

Companies in the apparel industry, like VF Corporation, 
typically have a significant portion of their balance sheet allocated to inventory. 
This includes raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods. 

In contrast, healthcare companies like Johnson & Johnson may have lower inventory
levels as their products often have longer lifecycles and require less frequent replenishment.

**Inventory Turnover Ratio:** 

This ratio measures how efficiently a company manages its inventory. 

For apparel companies, a high inventory turnover ratio indicates efficient inventory management, 
as they typically need to regularly replenish their product offerings to meet changing fashion trends. 

(The apparel industry typically relies on maintaining an appropriate level of inventory to meet customer demand. 
In the balance sheet, assessing the inventory turnover ratio and the composition of inventory 
(e.g., raw materials, work-in-progress, finished goods) is important to gauge the efficiency of inventory management.)

In contrast, healthcare companies may have a lower inventory turnover ratio due to longer product lifecycles or manufacturing processes.

### 2. Accounts Receivable: 

Accounts Receivable: Healthcare companies, including Johnson & Johnson, often have a higher proportion of 
accounts receivable due to the complexities of billing insurance companies, healthcare providers, 
and government reimbursement programs. In contrast, apparel companies typically have shorter credit periods 
and faster collection cycles, resulting in lower accounts receivable.

The financial ratio that measures the proportion of accounts receivable on a company's balance sheet is called the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio.

The Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio calculates how many times, on average, a company collects its accounts receivable within a given period. It indicates how efficiently a company is managing its credit sales and collecting payments from customers. The formula for the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is:

Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable

Net Credit Sales represent the total credit sales made by the company during the period, while Average Accounts Receivable is the average value of accounts receivable over the same period.

A higher Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio suggests that a company is collecting payments from customers more quickly, which indicates effective credit management and strong cash flow. Conversely, a lower ratio may indicate slower collections, potentially signaling issues with credit policies, customer payment delays, or the quality of receivables.


### 2. Discuss what these balance sheet differences suggest about differences in the financial positions of the two companies.

Compares a given company financial ratio to an industry average would be best practice, since these ratios typically differ by industry.

But this problem asks for a comparison between the companies without taking into account the industry. 

It's important to note that the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio should be compared to industry benchmarks or the company's historical data to gain meaningful insights. Additionally, the ratio should be considered in conjunction with other factors, such as industry-specific credit terms and customer payment practices, to obtain a comprehensive assessment of a company's accounts receivable management.

what financial ration measures the portion of  balance sheet allocated to inventory

The financial ratio that measures the portion of the balance sheet allocated to inventory is called the Inventory Turnover Ratio.

The Inventory Turnover Ratio is calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold (COGS) by the average inventory during a specific period. It indicates how quickly a company is able to sell its inventory and replace it with new inventory. The formula for the Inventory Turnover Ratio is:

Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory

A higher inventory turnover ratio suggests that a company is effectively managing its inventory and selling products efficiently. On the other hand, a lower ratio may indicate slower inventory turnover, which could be a sign of excess inventory or potential issues with sales and demand.

It's important to note that the Inventory Turnover Ratio should be analyzed in the context of the specific industry and company dynamics. Different industries have different inventory turnover benchmarks, so it's valuable to compare a company's ratio with its industry peers or historical data to gain a better understanding of its performance.
