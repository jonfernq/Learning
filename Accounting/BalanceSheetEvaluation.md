## Balance Sheet Comparison 

### 1. Discuss two ways in which the balance sheets differ across two companies.
  
VF Corporation is an apparel and footwear manufacturing company that owns well-known brands such as The North Face, Vans, Timberland, Wrangler, and Lee. Here are financial ratios that allow balance sheet comparison between companies: 

                                                           2022        2021       2020       2018       2017

Johnson & Johnson is a healthcare company that develops and manufactures pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer healthcare products, with notable brands including Band-Aid, Tylenol, Neutrogena, and Johnson's Baby. Here are financial ratios that allow balance sheet comparison between companies:

                                                           2022        2021       2020       2018       2017

Comparing the financial ratios for the two companies, one can see that the receivables turnover ratio is always substantially higher for the garment manufacturer VF Corporation than it is for the pharmaceutical firm Johnson & Johnson. 

Though the inventory turnover ratio for 2022 is roughly the same for the two companies, before this, the inventory ratio was  substantially higher for the garment manufacturer than it is for the pharmaceutical company. 

Does this meet expectations according to industry norms? We now address this question.

### 1. Inventory

The Inventory Turnover Ratio measures how efficiently a company manages its inventory.

Apparel companies like VF Corporation, 
typically have a significant portion of their balance sheet allocated to inventory. 
This includes raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods.  

For apparel companies, a high inventory turnover ratio indicates efficient inventory management, 
as they typically need to regularly replenish their product offerings to meet changing fashion trends.

In contrast, healthcare companies like Johnson & Johnson may have lower inventory
levels and a lower inventory turnover ratio as their products often have longer lifecycles and manufacturing processes, and thus require less frequent replenishment.

These expectations match the pattern in the Balance Sheet data presented above.

### 2. Accounts Receivable: 

The financial ratio that measures the proportion of accounts receivable on a company's balance sheet is called the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio.

The Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio calculates how many times, on average, a company collects its accounts receivable within a given period. It indicates how efficiently a company is managing its credit sales and collecting payments from customers. The formula for the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is:

Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable

Net Credit Sales represent the total credit sales made by the company during the period, while Average Accounts Receivable is the average value of accounts receivable over the same period.

A higher Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio suggests that a company is collecting payments from customers more quickly, which indicates effective credit management and strong cash flow. Conversely, a lower ratio may indicate slower collections, potentially signaling issues with credit policies, customer payment delays, or the quality of receivables.

Healthcare companies, including Johnson & Johnson, often have a higher proportion of 
accounts receivable due to the complexities of billing insurance companies, healthcare providers, 
and government reimbursement programs. 

In contrast, apparel companies typically have shorter credit periods 
and faster collection cycles, resulting in lower accounts receivable.

These expectations are not met in the Balance Sheet Data prezented above. 

### 2. Discuss what these balance sheet differences suggest about differences in the financial positions of the two companies.

Keeping in mind that both ratios are higher for the garment manufacturer VF Corporation than they are for the Pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson, a higher Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio or Inventory Turnover Ratio can have implications for different parts of the balance sheet, including liabilities, assets, and owners' equity. Here's how each ratio can impact these components:

1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio:
    
    * Assets: A higher accounts receivable turnover ratio indicates that a company is collecting its receivables more quickly. This means that accounts receivable, which is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet, will decrease. The reduction in accounts receivable can lead to a decrease in total assets.
    * Liabilities: If a company is able to collect receivables more efficiently, it may improve its cash flow position, which can positively impact liquidity and the ability to meet short-term obligations.
    * Owners' Equity: If the improvement in accounts receivable turnover is associated with increased profitability, it can result in higher net income. Higher net income can, in turn, contribute to an increase in retained earnings and owners' equity over time.
2. Inventory Turnover Ratio:
    
    * Assets: A higher inventory turnover ratio indicates that a company is selling its inventory more quickly. This suggests efficient management of inventory levels and a lower investment in inventory. As a result, the inventory balance, which is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet, will decrease. This reduction in inventory can lead to a decrease in total assets.
    * Liabilities: Efficient inventory management can positively impact a company's working capital and liquidity, which may indirectly improve the ability to meet short-term obligations.
    * Owners' Equity: If a higher turnover ratio leads to improved profitability and cost management, it can indirectly lead to higher net income. This, in turn, can contribute to an increase in retained earnings and owners' equity.

Other factors, such as the company's sales growth, pricing strategy, credit policy, and capital structure, should also be considered when analyzing the overall effect on the balance sheet, all of which is beyond the scope of this short analysis.
